ShoyuUma  O
4.2/5  O

I  O
am  O
not  O
a  O
big  O
fan  O
of  O
rich  O
greasy  O
ramen  O
broth  O
so  O
I  O
opt  O
for  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Shoyu  O
Uma  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
13.50  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
bowl  O
of  O
ramen  O
may  O
look  O
simple  O
yet  O
each  O
sip  O
of  O
the  O
fragrant  O
shoyu  O
broth  O
was  O
truly  O
an  O
enjoyment  O
.  O

Besides  O
the  O
broth  O
,  O
the  O
other  O
highlight  O
at  O
Bari  O
Uma  O
is  O
their  O
wheat  O
flour  O
noodles  O
.  O

The  O
noodle  O
is  O
thicker  O
with  O
a  O
firmer  O
and  O
springier  O
texture  O
.  O

Miso  O
Uma  O
3.8/5  O

The  O
Miso  O
Uma  O
(  O

16  O
)  O
which  O
comes  O
with  O
only  O
diced  O
flamed  O
charshu  O
and  O
corns  O
seem  O
rather  O
expensive  O
compared  O
to  O
the  O
other  O
ramen  O
which  O
comes  O
with  O
thick  O
cut  O
flamed  O
charshu  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
a  O
decent  O
bowl  O
of  O
miso  O
broth  O
but  O
it  O
justgave  O
the  O
feeling  O
ofbeing  O
short  O
changed  O
with  O
the  O
pricing  O

Kara  O
Uma  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O

I  O
have  O
ever  O
tried  O
.  O

According  O
to  O
the  O
restaurant  O
,  O
it  O
is  O
spicier  O
than  O
what  O
is  O
served  O
in  O

to  O
suit  O
the  O
local  O
taste  O
and  O
love  O
for  O

bbbbbb  O
Aji  O
Tama  O
Uma  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O

.  O

The  O
broth  O
was  O
really  O
very  O
rich  O
and  O
robust  O
but  O
it  O
did  O
not  O
give  O
the  O
feeling  O
of  O
being  O
too  O
complex  O
in  O
flavours  O
.  O

For  O
just  O
a  O

Bari  O

also  O
offers  O
a  O

.  O

The  O
Gyoza  O
(  O

was  O
nice  O
but  O
not  O

The  O

was  O

the  O

Aburi  O
Charshu  O
4.5/5  O

The  O
other  O
star  O
of  O

has  O
to  O
be  O
the  O
Aburi  O
Charshu  O
(  O

simply  O
melted  O

It  O
was  O

good  O
that  O
we  O
ordered  O

maybe  O
the  O

its  O
ramen  O
has  O
already  O
received  O
many  O
good  O
reviews  O
and  O
I  O
concurred  O
that  O
after  O
trying  O
out  O
their  O

.  O

Just  O
like  O
their  O
sloganSaikyo  O

,  O
the  O

is  O
indeed  O
very  O
rich  O

mellow  O

The  O

The  O
bbbbbb  O
Duck  O
Pot  O
Pie  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
22  O
)  O
is  O
a  O
welcome  O

is  O
used  O
for  O
the  O

A  O
good  O
twist  O
to  O
the  O
norm  O
but  O
I  O
still  O
prefer  O
my  O

to  O
cool  O
down  O
the  O
sunny  O
Singapore  O
weather  O

I  O
prefer  O
the  O
outdoor  O

comes  O
with  O
a  O
scenic  O
sea  O
view.Kids  O
can  O
also  O
be  O

Being  O

Although  O
the  O

selection  O
is  O
not  O
as  O
extensive  O
compared  O
to  O
others  O
,  O
it  O
definitely  O
made  O
up  O
for  O

with  O
its  O

.  O

My  O

began  O
with  O
some  O

.  O

The  O
oyster  O
was  O
not  O
as  O
fleshy.It  O
was  O
briny  O
and  O
fresh  O
.  O

Given  O
a  O
choice  O
,  O
I  O
would  O
still  O
prefer  O
my  O
oyster  O
to  O
be  O
creamy  O
and  O
fatter  O
.  O

Moving  O
on  O
to  O
the  O
cooked  O

The  O
venue  O
for  O
January  O
2013  O
Makansutra  O
dinner  O
was  O
held  O
at  O
bbbbbb  O
Yummy  O
Recipes  O
/bbbbbb  O
at  O
Aljunied  O
which  O
was  O
opened  O
in  O
November  O
2011  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
not  O
heard  O
of  O
the  O
restaurant  O
until  O
makansutra  O
dinner  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
after  O
some  O
research  O
and  O
chatting  O
with  O
my  O
dinner  O
mates  O
did  O
I  O
realise  O
the  O
owner  O
behind  O
Yummy  O
Recipes  O
is  O
the  O
same  O
owner  O
for  O
Yummy  O
Claypot  O
at  O
Joo  O
Chiat  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
visited  O
Yummy  O
Claypot  O
on  O
a  O
few  O
occasions  O
and  O
I  O
really  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
food  O
there  O
.  O

Hence  O
I  O
was  O
looking  O
forward  O
to  O
their  O
new  O
fine  O
oriental  O
dining  O
concept  O
at  O
Yummy  O
Recipes  O
.  O

From  O
a  O
shop  O
house  O
in  O
Joo  O
Chiat  O
,  O
Yummy  O
Holdings  O
expands  O
into  O
a  O
full  O
fledged  O
restaurant  O
with  O
its  O
bold  O
and  O
elegant  O
decor  O
that  O
emphasises  O
on  O
antique  O
and  O
chinese  O
culture  O
.  O

The  O
hundred  O
years  O
old  O
elm  O
main  O
door  O
welcomes  O
you  O
to  O
the  O
restaurant  O
with  O
its  O
wooden  O
floorboards  O
that  O
are  O
made  O
from  O
century  O
old  O
recycle  O
planks  O
of  O
railway  O
sleepers  O
which  O
are  O
quality  O
hardwood  O
that  O
are  O
still  O
in  O
a  O
perfect  O
condition  O
.  O

The  O

also  O
made  O
of  O

while  O
the  O
beams  O
supporting  O
the  O

made  O
of  O

which  O
is  O

Walking  O

by  O
the  O

statues  O
of  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
``  O
Dragon  O
's  O
Nine  O
Descendants  O
/bbbbbb  O
``  O
.  O

According  O
to  O
a  O
popular  O
version  O
of  O
the  O
legend  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
said  O
that  O
a  O
dragon  O
once  O
gave  O
birth  O

Prosperous  O
Salmon  O
Yu  O
Sheng  O
3/5  O

In  O
conjunction  O
with  O
Chinese  O
New  O
Year  O
which  O
was  O
just  O
around  O
the  O
corner  O
,  O
we  O
started  O
with  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Yu  O
Sheng  O
/bbbbbb  O
to  O
usher  O
in  O
the  O
Year  O
of  O
the  O
Snake  O
.  O

I  O
understand  O
from  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
makansutra  O
regulars  O
,  O
this  O
is  O
part  O
of  O
the  O
makansutra  O
dinner  O
tradition  O
every  O
year  O
.  O

Steamed  O
Prawn  O
with  O
Garlic  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
bbbbbb  O
Steamed  O
Prawn  O
with  O
Garlic  O
/bbbbbb  O
was  O
nothing  O
special  O
but  O
showcased  O
the  O
freshness  O
and  O
how  O
the  O
used  O
simple  O
ingredients  O
can  O
lift  O
a  O
dish  O
to  O
a  O
new  O
dimension  O
.  O

Double  O
Prosperity  O
Baby  O
Kailan  O
3/5  O

The  O
bbbbbb  O
Baby  O
Kailan  O
/bbbbbb  O
done  O
2  O
ways  O
was  O
interesting  O
especially  O
but  O
not  O
fantastic  O
.  O

The  O
deep  O
fried  O
Kailan  O
had  O
a  O
nice  O
crunch  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
quite  O
bland  O
and  O
bitter  O
.  O

I  O
still  O
prefer  O
the  O
stir  O
fried  O
baby  O
kailan  O
.  O

Yummy  O
Imperial  O
Chicken  O
3/5  O

The  O
Yummy  O
Imperial  O
Chicken  O
was  O
nice  O
but  O
not  O
memorable  O
.  O

The  O
star  O
was  O
actually  O
the  O
garlic  O
dipping  O
sauce  O
for  O
the  O
chicken  O
.  O

Braised  O
Sea  O
Cucumber  O
with  O
Pork  O
Knuckle  O
3.8/5  O

I  O
thought  O
the  O
combination  O
of  O
Braised  O
Sea  O
Cucumber  O
with  O
Pork  O
Knuckle  O
was  O
rather  O
unique  O
.  O

At  O
least  O
for  O
me  O
,  O
I  O
have  O
not  O
seen  O
such  O
combination  O
being  O
served  O
in  O
restaurants  O
.  O

Both  O
the  O
sea  O
cucumber  O
and  O
pork  O
knuckle  O
were  O
cooked  O
until  O
fork  O
tender  O
that  O
melted  O
in  O
the  O
mouth  O
.  O

Special  O
Butter  O
Bun  O
3/5  O

The  O
Special  O
Butter  O
Bun  O
is  O
actually  O
the  O
same  O
as  O
steamed  O
custard  O
bun  O
.  O

The  O
lava  O
filling  O
was  O
delish  O
but  O
the  O
skin  O
of  O
the  O
bun  O
was  O
rather  O
dry  O
and  O
a  O
tad  O
thick  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

We  O
also  O
had  O
the  O
following  O
dishes  O
Chicken  O
in  O
Pig  O
Stomach  O
Soup  O
,  O
Glutinous  O
Rice  O
with  O
Wat  O
Meat  O
and  O
Homemade  O
Dou  O
Hua  O
which  O
I  O
did  O
not  O
manage  O
to  O
take  O
any  O
photos  O
.  O

Overall  O
I  O
felt  O
that  O
the  O
food  O
at  O
Yummy  O
Recipes  O
is  O
still  O
short  O
of  O
being  O
a  O
full  O
fledged  O
restaurant  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
nice  O
but  O
needs  O
to  O
raise  O
their  O
standard  O
from  O
the  O
Yummy  O
Claypot  O

One  O
will  O
not  O
miss  O
the  O

and  O
white  O
theme  O
decor  O
of  O
Blu  O
Kouzina  O
located  O
along  O
Bukit  O
Timah  O
Road  O
.  O

The  O
Greek  O
Restaurant  O
opened  O
by  O
couple  O
Effie  O
and  O
Dennis  O
Tsakiris  O
created  O
a  O
warmmediterranean  O
sea  O
settingin  O
a  O
fourth  O
storey  O
building  O
,  O
born  O
out  O
of  O
the  O
founder  O
's  O
love  O
of  O
sharing  O
a  O
hearty  O
with  O
friends  O
.  O

Serving  O
Greek  O
cuisine  O
,  O
the  O
food  O
at  O
the  O
restaurant  O
is  O
cooked  O
using  O
their  O
own  O
family  O
brand  O
of  O
extra  O
virgin  O
olive  O
oil  O
called  O
Green  O
Gold  O
which  O
can  O
also  O
be  O
purchased  O
at  O
the  O
restaurant  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
understand  O
that  O
Blu  O
Kouzina  O
serves  O
authentic  O
Greek  O
food  O
that  O
has  O
not  O
been  O
adjusted  O
to  O
suit  O
the  O
local  O
palates  O
.  O

Pita  O
Bread  O
and  O
Dips  O
4/5  O

The  O
lunch  O
started  O
off  O
withPita  O
Bread  O
(  O
$  O
3  O
)  O
with  O
sea  O
salt  O
and  O
paprika  O
.  O

The  O
grilled  O
pita  O
bred  O
is  O
crisp  O
on  O
the  O
exterior  O
and  O
fluffy  O
inside  O
.  O

Pair  O
with  O
delectable  O
dips  O
that  O
is  O
available  O
in  O
the  O
menu  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
good  O
starter  O
tantalising  O
the  O
appetite  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
dips  O
we  O
tried  O
the  O
Fava  O
(  O
$  O
11.80  O
)  O
,  O
Taramosalata  O
(  O
$  O
13.80  O
)  O
and  O
Melitzanosalata  O
(  O
$  O
13.80  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
Fava  O
is  O
yellow  O
lentils  O
with  O
fresh  O
onion  O
,  O
oregano  O
and  O
extra  O
virgin  O
olive  O
oil  O
.  O

Taramosalata  O
iscod  O
roe  O
dip  O
and  O
Melitzanosalata  O
is  O
smoked  O
eggplant  O
mixed  O
with  O
herbs  O
.  O

I  O
could  O
not  O
make  O
up  O
my  O
mind  O
which  O
is  O
my  O
favourite  O
as  O
all  O
of  O
them  O
were  O
as  O
good  O
having  O
their  O
own  O
distinct  O
flavour  O
.  O

Grilled  O
Feta  O
3/5  O

This  O
is  O
the  O
first  O
time  O
I  O
was  O
served  O
with  O
the  O
whole  O
slice  O
of  O
Grilled  O
Feta  O
Cheese  O
(  O
$  O
12.80  O
)  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
not  O
an  O
expert  O
in  O
cheese  O
appreciation  O
but  O
the  O
feta  O
cheese  O
is  O
usually  O
a  O
bit  O
moist  O
,  O
salty  O
and  O
milky  O
.  O

After  O
being  O
grilled  O
,  O
it  O
lost  O
its  O
saltiness  O
but  O
not  O
the  O
milky  O
flavour  O
with  O
a  O
firmer  O
and  O
more  O
enjoyable  O
texture  O
to  O
it  O
.  O

Spanakopita  O
4.2/5  O

Love  O
the  O
Spanakopita  O
(  O
$  O
12.30  O
)  O
which  O
is  O
phylo  O
pastry  O
filled  O
with  O
spinach  O
,  O
feta  O
cheese  O
and  O
herbs  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
a  O
big  O
fan  O
of  O
spinach  O
and  O
cheesy  O
stuff  O
hence  O
the  O
filling  O
was  O
a  O
winning  O
combination  O
to  O
me  O
.  O

The  O
paper  O
thin  O
pastry  O
was  O
also  O
fried  O
to  O
a  O
nice  O
golden  O
brown  O
that  O
was  O
both  O
crispy  O
and  O
flaky  O
.  O

Kreatika  O
Anamikta  O
3/5  O

I  O
also  O
get  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
Kreatika  O
Anamikta  O

2pax  O
,  O
$  O
166.80  O

,  O
$  O

which  O
is  O
a  O
Meat  O
Platter  O
which  O
comes  O
with  O
meat  O
balls  O
,  O
kalamaki  O
,  O
bifteki  O
(  O
beef  O
patty  O
)  O
and  O
lamb  O
chops  O
.  O

Except  O
for  O
the  O
lamb  O
chops  O
which  O
was  O
really  O
flavoursome  O
and  O
succulent  O
,  O
the  O
rest  O
of  O
the  O
platter  O
was  O
rather  O
toughor  O
dry  O
.  O

Psari  O
Stin  O
Sxara  O
4.2/5  O

From  O
the  O
grill  O
again  O
,  O
the  O
Psari  O
Stin  O
Sxara  O
or  O
Greek  O
Grilled  O
Fish  O
(  O
Sea  O
Bream  O
400g  O
$  O
39.80  O
,  O
Sea  O
Bass  O
1kg  O
$  O
88.80  O
)  O
was  O
excellent  O
.  O

Nicely  O
grilled  O
to  O
a  O
smokey  O
flavour  O
,  O
the  O
fish  O
was  O
fresh  O
and  O
moist  O
.  O

Mousaka  O
4.2/5  O

Our  O
group  O
was  O
already  O
done  O
with  O
our  O
lunch  O
but  O
we  O
ca  O
n't  O
help  O
ordering  O
the  O
Mousaka  O
(  O
$  O
24.80  O
)  O
because  O
it  O
smelled  O
so  O
good  O
from  O
the  O
table  O
beside  O
us  O
.  O

The  O
traditional  O
Greek  O
dish  O
of  O
oven  O
baked  O
eggplant  O
with  O
potatoes  O
,  O
minced  O
meat  O
and  O
bechamel  O
sauce  O
was  O
really  O
hearty  O
and  O
comforting  O
.  O

I  O
really  O
like  O
the  O
decor  O
of  O
Blu  O
Kouzina  O
.  O

The  O
relax  O
and  O
casual  O
ambience  O
of  O
the  O
restaurant  O
made  O
one  O
felt  O
like  O
being  O
transported  O
to  O
Greek  O
or  O
the  O
Mediterranean  O
Sea  O
.  O

For  O
those  O
who  O
drives  O
,  O
not  O
to  O
worry  O
as  O
the  O
restaurant  O
offers  O
complimentary  O
valet  O
service  O

My  O
job  O
requires  O
me  O
to  O
travel  O
quite  O
often  O
and  O
I  O
always  O
craved  O
for  O
our  O
local  O
food  O
whenever  O
I  O
am  O
back  O
home  O
.  O

So  O
I  O
would  O
usually  O
head  O
down  O
to  O
the  O
nearest  O
food  O
centre  O
or  O
coffeeshop  O
to  O
satisfy  O
my  O
craving  O
.  O

One  O
of  O
my  O
favourite  O
local  O
food  O
is  O
the  O
Fried  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
or  O
Char  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
.  O

For  O
a  O
simpleplate  O
of  O
Fried  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
,  O
there  O
are  O
many  O
version  O
.  O

In  O
short  O
there  O
is  O
the  O
Penang  O
Fried  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
which  O
is  O
lighter  O
in  O
taste  O
while  O
the  O
local  O
version  O
is  O
sweeter  O
using  O
the  O
sweet  O
dark  O
sauce  O
.  O

Even  O
the  O
local  O
style  O
comes  O
in  O
wet  O
or  O
dry  O
version  O
.  O

My  O
preference  O
is  O
the  O
wet  O
version  O
.  O

Fried  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
4.5/5  O

Besides  O
the  O
Fried  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
stall  O
which  O
is  O
conveniently  O
located  O
at  O
the  O
coffeshop  O
just  O
next  O
block  O
where  O
I  O
am  O
staying  O
,  O
my  O
current  O
favourite  O
is  O
the  O
Fried  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
at  O
Zion  O
Riverside  O
Food  O
Centre  O
.  O

Each  O
batch  O
is  O
freshly  O
cooked  O
upon  O
order  O
hence  O
be  O
patient  O
with  O
the  O
long  O
queue  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
the  O
Fried  O
Kway  O
Teow  O
here  O
because  O
the  O
wetness  O
of  O
the  O
noodles  O
were  O
just  O
right  O
not  O
overly  O
done  O
.  O

In  O
addition  O
,  O
it  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
ingredients  O
such  O
as  O
cockles  O
,  O
slices  O
of  O

cake  O
,  O

The  O

it  O
was  O
quite  O

in  O

like  O
it  O
is  O

to  O
draw  O
the  O
crowd  O
to  O
the  O

Well  O
saying  O
that  O
,  O
there  O
is  O
really  O
not  O
many  O
things  O
interesting  O
to  O
do  O
in  O
Singapore  O
except  O
shop  O
,  O
eat  O
and  O
movie  O
so  O
why  O
not  O
just  O
house  O
them  O
under  O
one  O
roof  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
exactly  O
the  O
reason  O
why  O
I  O
was  O
at  O
Plaza  O

.  O

To  O
shop  O
,  O
catch  O
a  O

out  O
all  O
the  O
new  O
food  O
establishments  O
at  O
Plaza  O
Singapura  O
's  O

,  O
wedecided  O
to  O
try  O
Bangkok  O

which  O
is  O
the  O
less  O
crowded  O
since  O
we  O
have  O
a  O
movie  O
to  O
catch  O
.  O

We  O
ordered  O
a  O
Glass  O
Noodle  O
Seafood  O
Salad  O
(  O
$  O
10  O
)  O
to  O
kick  O
start  O
the  O
meal  O
.  O

It  O
did  O
come  O
with  O
fresh  O
huge  O
prawns  O
but  O
we  O
felt  O
that  O
it  O
was  O
lacking  O
the  O
spicy  O
kick  O
.  O

Tom  O

Seafood  O

For  O
the  O

my  O
partner  O
ordered  O
the  O
Tom  O
Yum  O
Seafood  O
Noodle  O
(  O
$  O
11.90  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
noodle  O
was  O
quite  O
springy  O
but  O
not  O
memorable  O
.  O

Minced  O
Chicken  O
and  O
Basil  O
3/5  O

For  O
myself  O
I  O
had  O
the  O
Minced  O
Chicken  O
and  O
Basil  O
(  O
$  O
11.90  O
)  O
which  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
fried  O
egg  O
and  O
rice  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
the  O
diced  O
long  O
beans  O
thatwas  O
added  O
to  O
the  O
minced  O
chicken  O
,  O
givinga  O
nice  O
crunch  O
to  O
the  O
dish.The  O
minched  O
chicken  O
and  O
basil  O
was  O
rather  O
average  O
,  O
it  O
lacked  O
that  O
strong  O

Galette  O
is  O
a  O
type  O
of  O
pancake  O
well  O
known  O
in  O
Brittany  O
,  O
North  O
West  O
of  O
France  O
made  O
from  O
organic  O
buckwheat  O
.  O

We  O
tried  O
the  O
Lucerne  O
(  O
$  O
18  O
)  O
which  O
is  O
served  O
like  O
a  O
pizza  O
with  O
mixed  O
seafood  O
,  O
creamy  O
tomato  O
sauce  O
and  O
mozzarella  O
on  O
top  O
a  O
thin  O
largegalette  O
.  O

As  O
the  O
pancake  O
is  O
rather  O
thin  O
,  O
this  O
need  O
to  O
be  O
eaten  O
quickly  O
if  O
not  O
the  O
pancake  O
will  O
become  O
soggy  O
.  O

Since  O
this  O
is  O
supposed  O
to  O
be  O
eaten  O
like  O
a  O
pizza  O
,  O
I  O
would  O
prefer  O
the  O
shell  O
of  O
the  O
mussel  O
and  O
tail  O
end  O
of  O
the  O
prawns  O
to  O
be  O
removed  O

The  O
spicy  O
mashed  O
potato  O
pancakes  O
was  O
quite  O
interesting  O
because  O
it  O
tasted  O
like  O
our  O
fried  O
carrot  O
cake  O
.  O

I  O
think  O
the  O
locals  O
will  O
like  O
this  O

Paddington  O

Their  O
savoury  O
is  O
not  O

Oslo  O
3.8/5  O

Another  O
flapjack  O
savoury  O
meal  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
is  O
Oslo  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
.  O

Comes  O
with  O
pinkish  O
smoked  O
salmon  O
and  O
cheesy  O
scrambled  O
eggs  O
with  O
grilled  O
zucchini  O
,  O
this  O
is  O
another  O
delightfully  O
hearty  O
meal  O
.  O

The  O
star  O
in  O
this  O
dish  O
was  O
actually  O
the  O
runny  O
scrambled  O
eggs  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

Dijon  O
4.2/5  O

For  O
the  O
savoury  O
pancakes  O
,  O
my  O
favourite  O
goes  O
to  O
Dijon  O
(  O
$  O
21  O
)  O
which  O
is  O
crepes  O
with  O
grilled  O
lamb  O
shoulders  O
with  O
peach  O
,  O
plum  O
and  O
passionfruit  O
mustard  O
dressing  O
.  O

The  O
hint  O
of  O
fruity  O
sweetness  O
from  O
the  O
dressing  O
on  O
top  O
of  O
the  O
lamb  O
shoulder  O
won  O
my  O
heart  O
.  O

In  O
my  O
opinion  O
,  O
the  O
soft  O
and  O
tissue  O
thin  O
crepe  O
complements  O
the  O
savoury  O
better  O
than  O
the  O
fluffy  O
thick  O
pancake  O
.  O

I  O
agreed  O
the  O
lamb  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
tough  O
but  O
overall  O
balance  O
in  O
flavour  O
and  O
texture  O
Dijon  O
stood  O
out  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

are  O
uniquely  O
served  O
with  O

pancakes  O

I  O
prefer  O
to  O
call  O
them  O
mini  O
pancakes  O
.  O

Its  O
kind  O
of  O
like  O
having  O

Chocolate  O
Roll  O
4.2/5  O

For  O
the  O
Sweet  O
Pannekoek  O
,  O
we  O
tried  O
the  O
Chocolate  O
Roll  O
(  O
$  O
13  O
)  O
with  O
peanut  O
butter  O
,  O
ice  O
cream  O
,  O
Oreo  O
crumbs  O
,  O
chocolate  O
sauce  O
,  O
nuts  O
and  O
whipped  O
cream  O
.  O

Pannekoek  O
is  O
a  O
Dutch/Belgian  O
pancake  O
that  O
is  O
usually  O
larger  O
and  O
much  O
thinner  O
than  O
American  O
or  O
Scottish  O
pancakes  O
.  O

The  O
chocolate  O
roll  O
pannekoek  O
reminds  O
me  O
of  O
the  O
local  O
snack  O
,  O
Min  O

in  O
a  O

It  O
feltlike  O
a  O
breakfast  O
bowl  O
.  O

We  O
thought  O
the  O
Bombon  O
Dollars  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
dry  O
to  O
eat  O
with  O
until  O
we  O
realized  O
we  O
need  O
to  O
pour  O
the  O
condensed  O
milk  O
into  O
the  O
bowl  O
.  O

Chocolate  O

that  O

a  O

The  O

a  O
golden  O
ring  O
around  O
the  O
edge  O
with  O
a  O
crisp  O

the  O

The  O

are  O
prepared  O
freshly  O
daily  O
at  O
the  O

A  O
little  O
patient  O
is  O
needed  O
as  O
the  O
pancakes  O
are  O
flipped  O
upon  O
order  O
and  O
served  O
right  O
from  O
the  O
pan  O
to  O

Paddington  O

has  O
an  O
extensive  O
varieties  O
of  O

I  O
have  O
a  O

I  O
have  O
always  O
wanted  O
to  O
try  O
The  O
Halia  O
at  O
Botanic  O
Garden  O
but  O
the  O
thought  O
of  O
the  O
inaccessibility  O
always  O
put  O
me  O
off  O
.  O

When  O
I  O
heard  O
that  O
Halia  O
has  O
opened  O
a  O
new  O
restaurant  O
at  O
Raffles  O
Hotel  O
Singapore  O
,  O
I  O
jumped  O
on  O
the  O
opportunity  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O
new  O
establishment  O
.  O

A  O
highlight  O
of  O
The  O
Halia  O
at  O
Raffles  O
Hotel  O
is  O
its  O
al  O
fresco  O
bar  O
that  O
serve  O
handcrafted  O
artisanal  O
beverage  O
products  O
around  O
the  O
world  O
.  O

The  O
Halia  O
at  O
Raffles  O
Place  O
is  O
located  O
at  O
the  O
defunct  O
Seah  O
Street  O
Deli  O
.  O

Position  O
as  O
an  O
urban  O
casual  O
restaurant  O
,  O
serving  O
contemporary  O
European  O
cuisine  O
with  O
Asian  O
touches  O
,  O
the  O
restaurant  O
has  O
removed  O
the  O
usual  O
appetiser  O
and  O
mains  O
from  O
the  O
menu  O
.  O

Instead  O
it  O
introduces  O
an  O
unique  O
concept  O
of  O
small  O
plates  O
and  O
big  O
plates  O
to  O
encourage  O
communal  O
as  O
well  O
as  O
customising  O
your  O
own  O
degustation  O
in  O
a  O
fun  O
and  O
flexible  O
manner  O
.  O

Foie  O
Gras  O
Salad  O
3.8/5  O

From  O
the  O
small  O
plates  O
,  O
we  O
tried  O
the  O
Foie  O
Gras  O
Salad  O
,  O
Chicken  O
Breast  O
Salad  O
,  O
Celeriac  O
Lasagna  O
,  O
Confit  O
Salmon  O
and  O
Oriental  O
Pulled  O
Duck  O
.  O

Some  O
of  O
us  O
do  O
not  O
like  O
our  O
greens  O
because  O
of  O
the  O
bitterness  O
.  O

The  O
apricot  O
chutney  O
and  O
blueberry  O
of  O
the  O
Foie  O
Gras  O
Salad  O
(  O
$  O
23  O
)  O
masked  O
off  O
that  O
unpleasant  O
taste  O
,  O
giving  O
the  O
greens  O
a  O
nice  O
fruity  O
sweetness  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
the  O
sweetness  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
overwhelming  O
towards  O
the  O
end  O
when  O
the  O
greens  O
got  O
lesser  O
.  O

Chicken  O
Breast  O
Salad  O
4.2/5  O

Moving  O
on  O
to  O
the  O
other  O
salad  O
small  O
plate  O
,  O
The  O
Chicken  O
Breast  O
Salad  O
(  O
$  O
14  O
)  O
was  O
more  O
balanced  O
in  O
execution  O
and  O
flavours  O
.  O

The  O
radish  O
,  O
chilli  O
,  O
hazelnut  O
and  O
ginger  O
flower  O
dressing  O
worked  O
in  O
harmony  O
while  O
the  O
chicken  O
breast  O
was  O
surprisingly  O
tender  O
and  O
moist  O
.  O

Celeriac  O
Lasagna  O
4.2/5  O

This  O
is  O
one  O
dish  O
at  O
Halia  O
that  O
everyone  O
is  O
raving  O
about  O
.  O

The  O
Celeriac  O
Lasagna  O
(  O
$  O
12  O
)  O
is  O
a  O
vegetarian  O
dish  O
but  O
adoresby  O
carnivores  O
too  O
.  O

The  O
innovative  O
dish  O
substituted  O
the  O
lasagna  O
noodles  O
with  O
slices  O
of  O
celeriac  O
.  O

Instead  O
of  O
meaty  O
mixture  O
,  O
a  O
vegetarian  O
mixture  O
of  O
mushroom  O
,  O
thyme  O
,  O
baby  O
spinach  O
,  O
lemon  O
and  O
madeira  O
cream  O
is  O
used  O
.  O

The  O
earthy  O
flavours  O
and  O
the  O
crunchy  O
celeriac  O
opened  O
my  O
eyes  O
to  O
the  O
world  O
of  O
culinary  O
and  O
changed  O
my  O
mindset  O
about  O
vegetarian  O
dish  O
.  O

Confit  O
Salmon  O
4.5/5  O

The  O
exquisite  O
Salmon  O
Confit  O
(  O
$  O
16  O
)  O
was  O
surrounded  O
by  O
a  O
beautiful  O
garden  O
of  O
roast  O
floret  O
,  O
tomato  O
and  O
cauliflower  O
puree  O
with  O
vanilla  O
.  O

The  O
pinkish  O
salmon  O
was  O
cooked  O
to  O
perfection  O
.  O

Thetexture  O
of  O
the  O
cauliflower  O
puree  O
was  O
smooth  O
.  O

However  O
I  O
did  O
not  O
really  O
enjoy  O
the  O
vanilla  O
flavour  O
with  O
the  O
cauliflower  O
puree  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
glad  O
to  O
just  O
leave  O
out  O
the  O
vanilla  O
.  O

Oriental  O
Pulled  O
Duck  O
3.5/5  O

The  O
Oriental  O
Pulled  O
Duck  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
is  O
an  O
interesting  O
dish  O
,  O
light  O
and  O
refreshing.The  O
oriental  O
pulled  O
duck  O
was  O
packed  O
with  O
flavours  O
while  O
the  O
soba  O
provided  O
the  O
texture  O
contrast.It  O
was  O
something  O
different  O
for  O
a  O
contemporary  O
European  O
cuisine  O
restaurant  O
but  O
not  O
memorable  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

Potato  O
Fries  O

Coated  O
Asparagus  O
3/5  O

After  O
trying  O
out  O
the  O
the  O
small  O
plates  O
,  O
we  O
had  O
some  O

(  O

and  O
Polenta  O

paired  O
with  O

The  O
Javanese  O
Spice  O
Maori  O
Lakes  O
Rack  O
of  O

Served  O
with  O
eggplant  O

and  O
red  O
pepper  O
relish  O
,  O
the  O
lamb  O
was  O
tender  O
and  O
not  O
gamy  O
.  O

There  O
was  O
a  O
hint  O
of  O
sweetness  O
on  O
the  O
lamb  O
,  O
probably  O
from  O
the  O
marination  O
of  O
the  O
javanese  O
spice  O
.  O

well  O
received  O
dish  O
for  O
the  O
tonight  O

Pardon  O
the  O

Another  O
Halia  O
classic  O
is  O
the  O
Ginger  O

Parfait  O
(  O

I  O
am  O
taken  O
back  O
how  O
spices  O
(  O
ginger  O
,  O
anise  O
,  O
cinnamon  O
)  O
can  O
work  O
beautifully  O
for  O
dessert  O
too  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
also  O
smartly  O
harmonised  O
with  O
the  O
fruity  O
sweetness  O
of  O
pineapple  O
.  O

Sticky  O
Toffee  O
Pudding  O
3.5/5  O

The  O
Sticky  O
Toffee  O
Pudding  O
(  O
$  O
10  O
)  O
may  O
look  O
rather  O
boring  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
really  O
quite  O
good  O
.  O

The  O
date  O
pudding  O
was  O
moist  O
and  O
was  O
excellently  O
paired  O
with  O
butterscotch  O
sauce  O
,  O
sea  O
salt  O
and  O
vanilla  O
ice  O
cream  O
.  O

just  O
ca  O

fault  O
it  O
.  O

The  O
Chocolate  O
and  O
Orange  O
Custard  O
(  O
$  O
10  O
)  O
was  O
bursting  O
with  O
richness  O
.  O

The  O
shortbread  O
and  O
almond  O
provided  O
that  O
lovely  O
texture  O
on  O
top  O
of  O
the  O
rich  O
flavour  O
.  O

Chilled  O
Strawberry  O
Soup  O
3/5  O

Before  O
serving  O
,  O
some  O
sparking  O
wine  O
is  O
poured  O
into  O
the  O
Chilled  O
Strawberry  O
Soup  O
(  O
$  O
12  O
)  O
.  O

A  O
light  O
and  O
refreshing  O
dessert  O
suitable  O
for  O
the  O
humid  O
Singapore  O
weather  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
nice  O
but  O
soup  O
for  O
dessert  O
is  O
a  O
first  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

It  O
probably  O
takes  O
a  O
while  O
for  O
me  O
to  O
really  O
appreciate  O
it  O
.  O

We  O

The  O
Foie  O
Gras  O
Terrine  O
was  O
nice  O
but  O
did  O
not  O
really  O
get  O
me  O
excited  O
.  O

I  O
still  O
prefer  O
my  O
foie  O
gras  O
pan  O
seared.Nevertheless  O
,  O
the  O
sweetness  O
of  O
the  O
pineapple  O
chutneygoes  O
very  O
well  O
with  O
the  O
foie  O
gras  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
enjoyed  O
spreading  O
the  O
foie  O
gras  O
over  O
the  O
bread  O
and  O
eating  O
it  O
that  O
way  O
.  O

I  O
felt  O
that  O
the  O
black  O
oilve  O
crumber  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
redundant  O
and  O
it  O
was  O
quite  O
hard  O

.  O

It  O
has  O
a  O

firm  O

The  O
Flaky  O

.  O

The  O
raddish  O

the  O

DANRO  O
uses  O
the  O
Ying  O
Yang  O
pot  O
or  O
what  O
we  O
called  O
the  O
half-half  O
pot  O
so  O
customers  O
can  O
get  O
to  O
have  O
choices  O
and  O
try  O
the  O
8  O
different  O
broth  O

I  O
got  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
following  O
soup  O
base  O
,  O
Spicy  O
Chicken  O
,  O
Tonkotsu  O
,  O
Chicken  O
&  O
Milk  O
and  O
Chicken  O
Miso  O
.  O

Accordingly  O
to  O
the  O
restaurant  O
,  O
Singaporean  O
prefers  O
the  O
chicken  O
and  O
pork  O
soup  O
base  O
.  O

Wafu  O
broth  O
is  O
more  O
suitable  O
for  O
the  O
Japanese  O
palate  O
,  O
the  O
local  O
may  O
not  O
be  O
able  O
to  O
appreciate  O
it  O
.  O

My  O
favourite  O
among  O
the  O
4  O
soup  O
base  O
I  O
tried  O
was  O
Chicken  O
&  O
Milk  O
.  O

The  O
Japanese  O
has  O
hot  O
pot  O
with  O
Kiritanpo  O
(  O
grilled  O
rice  O
skewer  O
)  O
which  O
is  O
a  O
culture  O
and  O
tradition  O
in  O
Japan  O
.  O

Kiri  O
means  O
cut  O
and  O
tanpo  O
means  O
rick  O
stick  O
.  O

DANRO  O
is  O
probably  O
the  O
first  O
restaurant  O
in  O
Singapore  O
to  O
be  O
serving  O
this  O
tradition  O
Japanese  O
food  O
and  O
it  O
is  O
complimentary  O
for  O
each  O
table  O
.  O

Currently  O
DANROserves  O
the  O
original  O

Kiritanpo  O
is  O
freshly  O

in  O
the  O

(  O
$  O

)  O
is  O
oven  O
baked  O

.  O

Shaped  O
like  O
a  O
sailing  O
boat  O
,  O
I  O
like  O
the  O
fact  O
that  O
the  O
potatoes  O
came  O
with  O
the  O
skin  O
.  O

It  O
gave  O
that  O
nice  O
extra  O
texture  O
contrast  O
.  O

Topped  O
with  O
seafood  O
,  O
the  O
creamy  O

was  O
a  O

for  O

Grilled  O

My  O
girlfriend  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
Grilled  O
Salmon  O
with  O
Fruit  O
Salsa  O
(  O
$  O
18.90  O
)  O
the  O
most  O
.  O

The  O
salmon  O
was  O
cooked  O
to  O
perfection  O
.  O

Cutting  O
into  O
the  O
salmon  O
revealed  O
the  O
pinkish  O
fish  O
meat  O
while  O
the  O
exterior  O
was  O
grilled  O
to  O
a  O
nice  O
crisp  O
.  O

Accompanied  O
by  O
the  O
refreshing  O
and  O

,  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
excellent  O
pairing  O
.  O

Tom  O
Yam  O
Spaghetti  O
with  O
Seafood  O
3.8/5  O

We  O
already  O
have  O
eateries  O
serving  O
chilli  O
crab  O
and  O
laksa  O
spaghetti  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
eager  O
to  O
try  O
this  O
fusion  O
creation  O
,  O
Tom  O
Yam  O
Spahetti  O
with  O
Seafood  O
(  O
$  O
16.90  O
)  O
.  O

Taste  O
wise  O
,  O
the  O
dish  O
has  O
potential  O
with  O
very  O
distinct  O
and  O
robust  O
flavours  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
tad  O
salty  O
during  O
my  O
visit  O
.  O

However  O
,  O
I  O
believe  O
with  O
a  O
little  O
quality  O
control  O
on  O
the  O
salt  O
,  O
this  O
can  O
be  O
another  O
fusion  O
pasta  O
dish  O
that  O
the  O
new  O
generation  O
will  O
enjoy  O
.  O

Nonya  O
Curry  O
Chicken  O
4.2/5  O

I  O
was  O
looking  O
forward  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
Nonya  O
Curry  O
Chicken  O
(  O
$  O
12.90  O
for  O
1pax  O
,  O
$  O
20.90  O
for  O
2pax  O
)  O
with  O
potatoes  O
and  O
carrots  O
served  O
with  O
bread  O
.  O

Many  O
that  O
have  O
visited  O
the  O
bistro  O
gave  O
good  O
reviews  O
for  O
their  O
curry  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
even  O
told  O
that  O
the  O
Indians  O
at  O
Little  O
India  O
also  O
like  O
their  O
Nonya  O
style  O
curry  O
.  O

So  O
did  O
it  O
disappoint  O
me  O
?  O

No  O
it  O
did  O
not  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
always  O
prefer  O
Nonya  O
curry  O
to  O
the  O
Chinese  O
curry  O
because  O
of  O
the  O
thick  O
gravy  O
and  O
spices  O
used  O
.  O

The  O
nonya  O
curry  O
chicken  O
also  O
came  O
with  O
large  O
pieces  O
of  O
tender  O
chicken  O
that  O
is  O
rather  O
value  O
for  O
money  O
.  O

Singaporean  O
probably  O
will  O
know  O
how  O
crowded  O
Little  O
India  O
can  O
be  O
during  O
the  O
weekends  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
the  O
fact  O
that  O
Steam  O
Sia  O
is  O
located  O
at  O
the  O
quieter  O
side  O
of  O
Little  O
India  O
away  O
from  O
the  O
crowd  O
where  O
I  O
can  O
enjoy  O
a  O
peaceful  O
meal  O
.  O

As  O
the  O
vicinity  O
does  O
not  O
offer  O
many  O
non  O
Indian  O
food  O
eateries  O
,  O
Steam  O
Sia  O
will  O
be  O
a  O
good  O
alternative  O
choice  O
for  O
a  O
different  O
.  O

With  O
more  O
budgets  O
hotels  O
being  O
builtin  O
thearea  O
,  O
it  O
may  O
also  O
offer  O
the  O
foreigners  O
a  O
cheaper  O
meal  O
alternative  O
andan  O
insight  O
of  O
Singapore  O

already  O
a  O

with  O
a  O

The  O

of  O
the  O

also  O
reminds  O
me  O
of  O
the  O

I  O
find  O
that  O
it  O
is  O
very  O
thoughtful  O

I  O
could  O

which  O
comes  O

to  O

sealing  O
the  O
beefy  O

flavours  O
.  O

The  O
buns  O
which  O
is  O
made  O
exclusively  O
by  O
a  O
local  O
bakery  O
is  O
light  O
and  O
springy  O
with  O

proportion  O

the  O

,  O
even  O
the  O

is  O
imported  O

I  O
like  O
my  O

Omakase  O

did  O
not  O
disappoint  O
me  O

Sweet  O

Fries  O
3/5  O

This  O
is  O
not  O
my  O
first  O
time  O
having  O
Sweet  O
Potato  O
Fries  O
.  O

Sofries  O
offers  O
it  O
too  O
.  O

The  O
sweetness  O
of  O
the  O
sweet  O
potato  O
served  O
as  O
french  O
fries  O
is  O
a  O
good  O
change  O
to  O
the  O
norm  O
.  O

A  O
little  O
disappointment  O
in  O
how  O
the  O
sweet  O
potato  O
fries  O
was  O
served  O
.  O

As  O
it  O
was  O
stacked  O
into  O
a  O
glass  O
,  O
the  O
water  O
vapour  O
has  O
caused  O
the  O
sweet  O
potato  O
fries  O
at  O
the  O
bottom  O
to  O
be  O
soaky  O
.  O

So  O
what  O
is  O
my  O
verdict  O
of  O
the  O
burger  O
?  O

Is  O
it  O
the  O
best  O
?  O

Yes  O
!  O

I  O
agreed  O
the  O
Omakase  O
Burger  O
is  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
best  O
in  O
town  O
.  O

However  O
will  O
the  O
burger  O
joint  O
be  O
successful  O
it  O
waits  O
to  O
be  O
seen  O
.  O

The  O
owner  O
may  O
have  O
found  O
the  O
right  O
formuale  O
for  O
the  O
best  O
burger  O
but  O
the  O
size  O
and  O
price  O
will  O
be  O
hard  O
to  O
convince  O
consumers  O
.  O

In  O

The  O
casual  O
dining  O
restaurant  O
offers  O
home  O
style  O
Medanese  O
food  O
which  O
reflects  O
the  O
diverse  O
cooking  O
styles  O
of  O
the  O
different  O
races  O
living  O
in  O
Medan  O
.  O

Bihun  O
Bebek  O
Dry  O
4/5  O

The  O
marquee  O
dish  O
at  O
Medan  O
Town  O
is  O
the  O
Bihun  O
Bebek  O
Dry/Soup  O
(  O
$  O
5.80  O
)  O
.  O

I  O
tried  O
the  O
beehoon  O
dry  O
served  O
with  O
duck  O
herbal  O
soup  O
on  O
the  O
side  O
.  O

Thebowl  O
of  O
beehoonwas  O
topped  O
with  O
generous  O
amount  O
of  O
shredded  O
duck  O
,  O
fried  O
garlic  O
,  O
spring  O
onion  O
and  O
bean  O
sprouts.I  O
understand  O
the  O
rice  O
noodle  O
is  O
made  O
in  O
Medan.It  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
unique  O
springy  O
texture  O
that  O
is  O
different  O
from  O
others  O
.  O

Nasi  O
RedangSapi  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
other  O
dish  O
at  O
Medan  O
Town  O
that  O
caught  O
my  O
attention  O
is  O
the  O
Nasi  O
Redang  O
Sapi  O
(  O
$  O
6.50  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
redang  O
was  O
extremely  O
tender  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
the  O
flavour  O
that  O
woke  O
my  O
palate  O
.  O

At  O
thatinstant  O
,  O
memories  O
of  O
Indonesia  O
trips  O
flashed  O
across  O
my  O
mind  O
,  O
an  O
authentic  O
taste  O
that  O
has  O
long  O
been  O
forgotten  O
.  O

Klepon  O
3/5  O

The  O
Klepon  O
(  O
$  O
2.50  O
for  O
5pc  O
)  O
is  O
boiled  O
rice  O
cake  O
stuffed  O
with  O
palm  O
sugar  O
and  O
rolled  O
in  O
grated  O
coconut  O
.  O

Singaporean  O
will  O
probably  O
known  O
it  O
better  O
as  O
oneh  O
oneh  O
.  O

The  O
rice  O
cake  O
has  O
a  O
nice  O
chewy  O
texture  O
but  O
I  O
am  O
a  O
bit  O
disappointed  O
with  O
the  O
fillings  O
.  O

I  O
prefer  O
the  O
palm  O
sugar  O
filling  O
to  O
be  O
of  O
flowing  O
fluid  O
form  O
.  O

Es  O
Campur  O
Medan  O
3/5  O
and  O
Es  O
Chendol  O
Medan  O
3/5  O

Wrapping  O
up  O
the  O
dinner  O
,  O
we  O
ordered  O
the  O
Campur  O
Medan  O
(  O
$  O
3  O
)  O
and  O
Chendol  O
Medan  O
(  O
$  O
3  O
)  O
.  O

Both  O
areshaved  O
ice  O
dessert  O
with  O
coconut  O
milk  O
and  O
palm  O
sugar  O
.  O

The  O
different  O
is  O
the  O
ingredients  O
used  O
.  O

I  O
preferred  O
the  O
Campur  O
Medan  O
over  O
the  O
Chendol  O
Medan  O
.  O

Although  O
the  O
chendol  O
was  O
homemade  O
,  O
the  O
colour  O
was  O
unappetising  O
and  O
lacking  O
in  O
texture  O
.  O

I  O
previously  O
visited  O
a  O
Medanese  O
cuisine  O
restaurant  O
and  O
was  O
not  O
impressed  O
with  O
the  O
food  O
.  O

Medan  O
Town  O
has  O
changed  O
my  O
opinion  O
with  O
Medanese  O
cuisine  O
and  O
I  O
amglad  O
to  O
discover  O
the  O
casual  O
dining  O
restaurant  O
.  O

Now  O
I  O
am  O
another  O
restaurant  O
to  O
go  O
to  O
when  O
I  O
am  O
crave  O
for  O
Indonesian  O

With  O
the  O
success  O
story  O
of  O
Nakhon  O
Kitchen  O
,  O
I  O
am  O
not  O
surprise  O
to  O
see  O
another  O
Thai  O
restaurant  O
opening  O
its  O
door  O
for  O
business  O
at  O
neighbourhood  O
area  O
.  O

Soi  O

is  O
established  O
about  O
six  O
months  O
ago  O
at  O

.  O

Relying  O
on  O
my  O
lunch  O
partner  O
,  O
Maureen  O
's  O
dining  O
experience  O
at  O
Nakhon  O
Kitchen  O
,  O
she  O
told  O
me  O
the  O
concept  O
at  O
Soi  O
Thai  O
Kitchen  O
is  O
similar  O
to  O
Nakhon  O
Kitchen  O
even  O
down  O
to  O
the  O
plates  O
usedfor  O
the  O
food  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
not  O
tried  O
Nakhon  O
Kitchen  O
because  O
I  O
was  O
always  O
turned  O
off  O
by  O
the  O
long  O
queues  O
.  O

Anyway  O
back  O
to  O
the  O
food  O
at  O

Kitchen  O
...  O

Thick  O

(  O

3.8/5  O

Came  O
with  O
fresh  O

and  O
mushrooms  O
,  O
the  O
Thick  O
Tom  O
Yum  O
Soup  O
(  O
$  O
6  O
)  O
was  O
not  O
too  O
spicy  O
.  O

I  O
felt  O
it  O
was  O
just  O
right  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
balanced  O
of  O
sourness  O
and  O
spiciness  O
.  O

Only  O
disappointmentthere  O
is  O
no  O
seafood  O
Tom  O
Yum  O
Soup  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
prefer  O
more  O
choices  O
in  O
my  O
tom  O
yum  O
soup  O
not  O
just  O
only  O
prawn  O
or  O
chicken  O
.  O

For  O
just  O
a  O
mere  O
6  O
dollar  O
,  O
the  O
portionwas  O
quite  O
worthy  O
.  O

Nicely  O
cooked  O
to  O
a  O

bite  O
,  O
the  O
Thai  O
Style  O
Kang  O
Kong  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
very  O
homely  O
flavour  O
.  O

Beef  O
Paneang  O
4.2/5  O

Using  O
beef  O
cheeks  O
for  O
the  O
Beef  O
Paneang  O
(  O
$  O
10  O
)  O
,  O
the  O
Thai  O
style  O
red  O
chilli  O
beef  O
was  O
my  O
favourite  O
.  O

The  O
beef  O
cheeks  O
were  O
extremely  O
tender  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
thin  O
layer  O
of  O
fats  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
not  O
really  O
a  O
spicy  O
dish  O
more  O
towards  O
the  O
sweetness  O
side  O
.  O

The  O
gravy  O
goes  O
with  O
the  O
rice  O
very  O
well  O
.  O

Thai  O
Yellow  O
Ginger  O
Chicken  O
4/5  O

The  O
Thai  O
Yellow  O
Ginger  O
Chicken  O
(  O
$  O
8  O
)  O
was  O
very  O
flavourful  O
,  O
nicely  O
coated  O
with  O
the  O
yellow  O
ginger  O
sauce  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O
was  O
tender  O
and  O
juicy  O
.  O

However  O
we  O
thought  O
the  O
dishcan  O
be  O
a  O
bit  O
spicier  O
.  O

Sea  O

with  O
Namjim  O

4.2/5  O

Something  O
for  O
a  O
different  O
this  O
time  O
,  O
I  O
tried  O
the  O
Sea  O
Bass  O
with  O
Namjim  O
Larb  O
(  O
$  O
22  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
highlight  O
was  O
the  O
Namjim  O
dipping  O
sauce  O
.  O

Made  O
with  O
ingredients  O
such  O
as  O
garlic  O
,  O
fish  O
sauce  O
,  O
lime  O
juices  O
,  O
sugar  O
and  O
chilli  O
,  O
the  O
sournesswent  O
very  O
well  O
with  O
the  O
fish  O
meat  O
.  O

In  O
addition  O
,  O
the  O
dipping  O
sauce  O
also  O
came  O
with  O
minced  O
pork  O
in  O
it  O
.  O

Mango  O

We  O
had  O
the  O
Mango  O
Sticky  O
Rice  O
(  O

5  O
)  O
wrapping  O
up  O
the  O
sumptuous  O
lunch  O
at  O
Soi  O

Kitchen  O
.  O

I  O
consider  O
Soi  O
Thai  O
Kitchen  O
value  O
for  O
money  O
with  O
the  O
wallet  O
friendly  O
pricing  O
.  O

At  O
Soi  O
Thai  O
Kitchen  O
,  O
you  O
can  O
also  O
send  O
back  O
your  O
food  O
for  O
adjustment  O
if  O
you  O
find  O
it  O
not  O
spicy  O
enough  O
or  O
too  O
spicy  O
to  O
your  O

Now  O
or  O
rather  O
for  O
the  O
moment  O
,  O
I  O
have  O
a  O
good  O
alternative  O
and  O
reason  O
to  O
skip  O

the  O
quaint  O
Kampong  O
Glam  O
conservation  O
area  O
along  O
Baghdad  O
Street  O
.  O

The  O
Sushi  O
Bar  O
interior  O
resembles  O
the  O
1930s  O
Douglas  O
DC-3  O
,  O
a  O
fixed-wing  O

.  O

Climbing  O
up  O
a  O
flight  O
of  O
stairs  O
leading  O
to  O
the  O
cabin  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
greeted  O
by  O
the  O
cheerful  O
leading  O
air  O
stewardess  O
Simbian  O
Chua  O
who  O
showed  O
us  O
to  O
our  O
first  O

The  O
food  O
at  O
SushiAirways  O
is  O
both  O
meticulous  O
and  O
exquisite  O
,  O
it  O
does  O
not  O
serve  O
the  O
usual  O
airline  O
food  O
that  O
is  O
pre-cooked  O
and  O
re-heat  O
before  O
serving  O

I  O
am  O
treated  O
to  O
some  O
items  O
on  O

'  O
Omakase  O
(  O

from  O

)  O
which  O
means  O
leaving  O
the  O

to  O
the  O

.  O

Starting  O
with  O
Red  O
Snapper  O
Fish  O
Roe  O
,  O
it  O
reminds  O
me  O
of  O
thepig  O
's  O
brain  O
which  O
I  O
used  O
to  O
eat  O
when  O
I  O
was  O
young  O
.  O

Look  O
can  O
be  O
quite  O
deceiving  O
but  O
this  O
light  O
and  O
refreshing  O
appertiser  O
paired  O
with  O
Chef  O
Wong  O
's  O
homemade  O
soy  O
sauce  O
was  O
very  O
''  O

''  O
.  O

When  O

and  O
nori  O
(  O

,  O
there  O
was  O
a  O
look  O
of  O
confusion  O
in  O
our  O
eyes  O
.  O

What  O
should  O
we  O
do  O
with  O
the  O
2  O
plates  O
of  O
ingredients  O
.  O

Lucky  O
the  O
captain  O
of  O
the  O
plane  O
came  O
to  O
our  O
rescue  O
,  O
he  O
told  O
us  O
to  O
to  O
eat  O
it  O
like  O
a  O
Temaki  O
Roll  O
(  O
Hand  O

.  O

This  O
is  O
a  O
first  O
for  O
me  O
to  O
Do-It-Yourself  O
a  O

(  O

.  O

The  O
fresh  O
ingredients  O
witha  O
nice  O
proportion  O
of  O

was  O
very  O
delectable  O
.  O

Miso  O
Soup  O
4/5  O

I  O
was  O
wondering  O
why  O
theMiso  O
Soupwas  O
served  O
in  O
the  O
midde  O
of  O
our  O
meal  O
instead  O
at  O
the  O
beginning  O
which  O
most  O
restaurants  O
do  O
.  O

Unlike  O
others  O
,  O
the  O
miso  O
soup  O
here  O
is  O
only  O
cook  O
a  O
la  O
minute  O
hence  O
it  O
was  O
not  O
as  O
salty  O
compared  O
to  O
those  O
thatwas  O
pre-cooked  O
and  O
kept  O
under  O
constant  O
heat  O
.  O

Mango  O
Roll  O
3.8/5  O

The  O
Mango  O
Roll  O
(  O
$  O
30  O
)  O
was  O
beautifully  O
presented  O
but  O
not  O
practical  O
.  O

The  O
mango  O
kept  O
sliding  O
down  O
from  O
the  O
sushi  O
roll  O
.  O

Hence  O
it  O
felt  O
like  O
the  O
flavours  O
were  O
separated  O
as  O
we  O
needed  O
to  O
eat  O
the  O
mango  O
separately  O
.  O

The  O
mango  O
was  O
also  O
not  O
sweet  O
enough  O
,  O
lacking  O
the  O
refreshing  O
contrast  O
in  O
taste  O
.  O

Avocado  O
Roll  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
Avocado  O
Roll  O
(  O
$  O
25  O
)  O
on  O
the  O
other  O

beautiful  O
executed  O
with  O
the  O

Soba  O
4.2/5  O

Not  O
available  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
is  O
the  O
cold  O
soba  O
made  O
from  O
yam  O
.  O

The  O
chef  O
explained  O
that  O
this  O
particular  O
soba  O
is  O
not  O
available  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
due  O
to  O
irregular  O
supply  O
from  O
Japan  O
.  O

However  O
,  O
if  O
it  O
is  O
available  O
they  O
will  O
recommend  O
it  O
to  O
the  O
customer  O
.  O

The  O
soba  O
is  O
paler  O
in  O
colour  O
,  O
thinner  O
and  O
smoother  O
in  O
texture  O
.  O

Have  O
you  O
heard  O
of  O
Bespoke  O
Cocktails  O
?  O

It  O
means  O
walking  O
into  O
a  O
bar  O
and  O
the  O
mixlogist  O
will  O
customise  O
your  O
drink  O
depending  O
on  O
your  O
mood  O
and  O
taste  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
not  O
been  O
to  O
one  O
until  O
recently  O
when  O
I  O
met  O
Maureen  O
for  O
a  O
drink  O
at  O
Bar  O
Stories  O
before  O
our  O
tasting  O
session  O
in  O
the  O
evening  O
.  O

Located  O
among  O
the  O
rows  O
of  O
shophouses  O
at  O
hip  O
Haji  O
lane  O
,  O
the  O
quirky  O
bar  O
located  O
at  O
the  O
2nd  O
floor  O
maybe  O
a  O
bit  O
difficult  O
to  O
spot  O
.  O

Upon  O
settling  O
down  O
in  O
the  O
bar  O
,  O
we  O
were  O
wondering  O
what  O
to  O
do  O
as  O
there  O
was  O
no  O
menu  O
around  O
.  O

The  O
owner  O
who  O
was  O
a  O
table  O
away  O
spotted  O
us  O
and  O
probably  O
he  O
couldtell  O
from  O
our  O
confused  O
face  O
,  O
came  O
over  O
and  O
asked  O
whether  O
it  O
is  O
our  O
first  O
time  O
at  O
Bar  O
Stories  O
.  O

After  O
giving  O
us  O
a  O
brief  O
introduction  O
of  O
the  O
place  O
andchecking  O
what  O
sort  O
oftaste/flavours  O
we  O
like  O
,  O
the  O
owner  O
asked  O
the  O
mixologist  O
tomix  O
a  O
cocktailfor  O
eachof  O
us  O
.  O

Maureen  O
who  O
is  O
crazy  O
with  O
Ispahan  O
requested  O
for  O
her  O
cocktail  O
to  O
come  O
with  O
lychee  O
and  O
rose  O
syrup  O
.  O

As  O
we  O
are  O
not  O
really  O
an  O
alcohol  O
person  O
,  O
the  O
cocktail  O
is  O
a  O
bit  O
too  O
strong  O
inalcohol  O
content  O
for  O
us  O
.  O

We  O
preferred  O
it  O
to  O
be  O
sweeter  O
.  O

Noticed  O
that  O
Maureen  O
did  O
not  O
finish  O
her  O
drink  O
,  O
the  O
owner  O
made  O
her  O
another  O
glass  O
of  O
cocktail  O
that  O
was  O
more  O
refreshing  O
and  O
sweeter  O
with  O
berries  O
and  O
grapes  O
flavours  O
partying  O
in  O
the  O
glass  O
.  O

As  O
I  O
preferred  O
sour  O
taste  O
,  O
the  O
mixologist  O
made  O
me  O
a  O
passionfruit  O
inspired  O
cocktail  O
.  O

The  O
cocktail  O
was  O
much  O
refreshing  O
and  O
easy  O
to  O
drink  O
compare  O
to  O
Maureen  O
's  O
Ispahan  O
inspired  O
cocktail  O
.  O

I  O
really  O
like  O
the  O
concept  O
of  O
bespoke  O
cocktails  O
.  O

The  O
excitement  O
and  O
thrill  O
of  O
a  O
different  O
customised  O
cocktail  O
depending  O
on  O
one  O
's  O
mood  O
and  O
taste  O
.  O

The  O
hidden  O
cocktail  O
bar  O
is  O
a  O
nice  O
chill  O
out  O
place  O
away  O
from  O
the  O
crowd  O
with  O
each  O
cocktail  O
ranges  O
from  O
$  O
20  O
to  O

Nana  O

A  O
long  O

is  O
served  O
at  O
Bornga  O

I  O
actually  O
adore  O
the  O
idea  O
instead  O
of  O

Interesting  O
fact  O
that  O
even  O

Samgyupsal  O

Samgyupsal  O
4.2/5  O

If  O
you  O
noticed  O
,  O
the  O
meat  O
at  O
Bornga  O
is  O
in  O
its  O
natural  O
colour  O
without  O
any  O
pre-marination  O
causing  O
the  O
colour  O
of  O
the  O
meat  O
to  O
be  O
dark  O
brown  O
or  O
black  O
.  O

Concerned  O
about  O
the  O
appearance  O
of  O
Korean  O
BBQ  O
meats  O
,  O
Chef  O
Paik  O
created  O
a  O
new  O
Korean  O
style  O
of  O
BBQ  O
while  O
keeping  O
the  O
natural  O
colour  O
and  O
taste  O
of  O
meats  O
.  O

The  O
Samgyupsal  O
or  O
Grilled  O
Pork  O
Belly  O
(  O
$  O
18  O
)  O
is  O
chosen  O
for  O
the  O
right  O
proportion  O
of  O
fat  O
and  O
meat  O
.  O

Surprisingly  O
the  O
grilled  O
pork  O
belly  O
tasted  O
as  O
good  O
or  O
even  O
much  O
better  O
in  O
its  O
natural  O
flavour  O
without  O
marination  O
.  O

Woo  O
Samgyup  O

Woo  O
Samgyup  O
4.5/5  O

The  O
star  O
attraction  O
and  O
probably  O
the  O
reason  O
for  O
repeated  O
customers  O
is  O
the  O
Woo  O
Samgyup  O
or  O
Thinly  O
Sliced  O
Beef  O
with  O
Bornga  O
's  O
Special  O
Sauce  O
(  O

.  O

Woo  O
Samgyup  O
is  O
served  O
shortly  O
after  O
being  O
doused  O
in  O
a  O
unique  O
dressing  O
that  O
retains  O
the  O
meat  O
's  O
natural  O
colour  O
while  O
enhancing  O
the  O
traditional  O
bulgogi  O
taste  O
.  O

The  O
beautiful  O
marbledmeat  O
was  O
tender  O
and  O
juicy  O
.  O

In  O
exact  O
fact  O
,  O
it  O
tasted  O
better  O
than  O
bulgogi/galbi  O
.  O

I  O
will  O
definitely  O
return  O
for  O
it  O
again  O
.  O

3  O

Another  O
signature  O
at  O
Bornga  O
is  O
the  O
Chadol  O
Duejang  O
Jjigae  O
(  O
$  O
16  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
Korean  O
beef  O
stew  O
made  O
with  O
rich  O
soybean  O
paste  O
is  O
reducedover  O
a  O
few  O
minutes  O
at  O

The  O

is  O
then  O
poured  O
over  O
the  O
rice  O
,  O
mixed  O
and  O
served  O
like  O
a  O
bibimbap  O
.  O

Each  O
mouthful  O
of  O
the  O
rice  O
coated  O
with  O
the  O
beef  O
stew  O
was  O
filled  O
with  O
wonderful  O
flavours  O

on  O

Jap  O

The  O
Jap  O

(  O

23  O
)  O
which  O
is  O
glass  O
noodles  O
stir  O
fried  O
with  O
pork  O
and  O
vegetables  O
.  O

The  O
silky  O
glass  O
noodles  O
were  O
nicely  O
flavoured  O
by  O
the  O
soy  O
sauce  O
but  O
I  O
felt  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
on  O
the  O
oily  O
side  O
.  O

Naengmyeon  O
4.2/5  O

Another  O
favourite  O
of  O
mine  O
in  O
Korean  O
cuisine  O
is  O
Naengmyeon  O
(  O
$  O
15  O
)  O
,  O
buckwheat  O
noodles  O
with  O
cold  O
broth  O
.  O

The  O
best  O
method  O
of  O
eatingcold  O
noodles  O
is  O
to  O
add  O
some  O
mustard  O
and  O
vinegar  O
to  O
it  O
.  O

The  O
combinations  O
of  O
sour  O
,  O
sweet  O
and  O
spicy  O
was  O
very  O
appetising  O
and  O
refreshing  O
summer  O
dish  O
for  O
the  O
Singapore  O
weather  O
.  O

Kimchi  O

Haemul  O
Pajeon  O
3.5/5  O

The  O
Haemul  O
Pajeon  O
(  O
$  O
22  O
)  O
,  O
Korean  O
pancake  O
made  O
with  O
scallions  O
and  O
a  O
variety  O
of  O
seafood  O
.  O

The  O
egg  O
batter  O
,  O
wheat  O
flour  O
and  O
rice  O
flour  O
mixture  O
was  O
not  O
too  O
thick  O
with  O
a  O
slight  O
crisp  O
on  O
the  O
surface  O
.  O

The  O
haemul  O
pajeon  O
itself  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
bland  O
and  O
it  O
is  O
best  O
enjoyed  O
with  O
the  O
dipping  O
sauce  O
.  O

Upon  O
settling  O
down  O
we  O
ordered  O
our  O
beverages  O
.  O

We  O
had  O
the  O
Lime  O
Soda  O
(  O

was  O

in  O

Since  O
this  O
is  O
a  O

bar  O
,  O
we  O
have  O
to  O
trytheir  O

Currently  O
there  O

I  O
odered  O
the  O
Pho  O
Wagyu  O
Beer  O
Slices  O
(  O
$  O
16.90  O
)  O
which  O
is  O
the  O
most  O
expensive  O
in  O
the  O
menu  O
.  O

Came  O
with  O
slices  O
of  O
beautiful  O
Wagyu  O
beef  O
that  O
was  O
cooked  O
by  O
the  O
delicious  O
broth  O
.  O

The  O
intense  O
broth  O
was  O
boiled  O
for  O
at  O
least  O
24  O
hours  O
.  O

The  O
rice  O
noodle  O
was  O
also  O
firm  O
and  O
smooth  O
.  O

My  O
girlfriend  O
felt  O
that  O
the  O
soup  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
sour  O
but  O
I  O
liked  O
the  O
soury  O
from  O
the  O
lime  O
and  O
the  O
fish  O
sauce  O
.  O

Mouse  O

I  O
was  O
not  O
aware  O
that  O
Vietnamese  O
has  O
mouse  O
tail  O
noodle  O
in  O
their  O
cuisine  O
.  O

The  O
noodle  O
is  O
similar  O
to  O
our  O
chinese  O
Mee  O
Tai  O
Mak  O
and  O
I  O
always  O
thought  O
only  O
the  O
Chinese  O
eats  O
that  O
.  O

The  O
Mouse  O
Tail  O
Noodle  O
Soup  O
(  O
$  O

apparently  O

breakfast  O

The  O
bowl  O
of  O

noodle  O
soup  O
came  O
with  O
fish  O
balls  O
and  O
slices  O
of  O
pig  O
leg  O
meat  O
.  O

The  O
soup  O
was  O
not  O
as  O
intense  O
compared  O
to  O
the  O
Pho  O
soup  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
lighter  O

'  O
Cooked  O
in  O
Hay  O
(  O

reminiscent  O
of  O
Chef  O

childhood  O
in  O
Austria  O
when  O
he  O
grew  O
up  O
on  O
his  O

was  O
aplenty  O

Mediterranean  O
Chicken  O
Salad  O
3.8/5  O

For  O
starter  O
,  O
there  O
is  O
a  O
choice  O
between  O
the  O
Mediterranean  O
Chicken  O
Salad  O
or  O
French  O
Onion  O
Soup  O
.  O

The  O
Mediterranean  O
Chicken  O
Salad  O
with  O
its  O
fresh  O
greens  O
and  O
chunky  O
chicken  O
topped  O
with  O
delectable  O
dressing  O
tantalized  O
the  O
appetite  O
.  O

The  O
tomatoes  O
and  O
grapes  O
gave  O
the  O
salad  O
a  O
fruity  O
and  O
freshing  O
touch  O
.  O

French  O
Onion  O
Soup  O
3/5  O

The  O
French  O
Onion  O
Soup  O
was  O
packed  O
with  O
flavours  O
but  O
all  O
of  O
us  O
at  O
the  O
table  O
agreed  O
that  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
salty  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
also  O
looking  O
for  O
more  O
caramalized  O
onions  O
in  O
the  O
soup  O
for  O
that  O
extra  O
textures  O
and  O
sweetness  O
.  O

The  O
flavours  O
were  O
all  O
there  O
,  O
it  O
just  O
need  O
a  O
bit  O
of  O
fine  O
tuning  O
to  O
make  O
it  O
better  O
.  O

Chicken  O
Ballotine  O
4/5  O

Christmas  O
is  O
about  O
turkey  O
but  O
the  O
meat  O
can  O
be  O
quite  O
tough  O
and  O
dry  O
if  O
it  O
is  O
not  O
done  O
properly  O
.  O

Hence  O
I  O
usually  O
avoid  O
turkey  O
whenever  O
it  O
is  O
possible  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
are  O
like  O
me  O
,  O
you  O
can  O
try  O
the  O
Chicken  O
Ballotine  O
Set  O
(  O
$  O
39  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O
stuffed  O
with  O
mushrooms  O
and  O
nuts  O
was  O
tender  O
and  O
flavourful  O
.  O

Just  O
picking  O
bones  O
here  O
,  O
I  O
thought  O
brown  O
sauce  O
is  O
a  O
bit  O
too  O
classic  O
.  O

It  O
will  O
be  O
good  O
if  O
we  O
can  O
have  O
a  O
saucethat  O
is  O
more  O
contrasting  O
and  O
adds  O
colour  O
to  O
the  O
dish  O
.  O

Guinness  O
Battered  O
Fish  O
&  O
Chips  O
4.2/5  O

When  O
I  O
visited  O
Backyard  O
@  O
Dempsey  O
in  O
August  O
2012  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
told  O
that  O
Guinness  O
is  O
the  O
best  O
beer  O
for  O
battered  O
fish  O
but  O
the  O
dark  O
colour  O
appearance  O
is  O
not  O
very  O
presentable  O
so  O
they  O
have  O
the  O
Kronenbourg  O
Beer  O
Battered  O
Fish  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
instead  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
quite  O
excited  O
when  O
I  O
knew  O
I  O
am  O
going  O
to  O
finally  O
taste  O
the  O
Guinness  O
Battered  O
Fish  O
and  O
Chips  O
Set  O
(  O
$  O
34  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
battered  O
fish  O
came  O
with  O
hint  O
of  O
beer  O
flavour  O
,  O
nicely  O
crisp  O
on  O
the  O
exterior  O
and  O
moist  O
inside  O
.  O

Pork  O
Roulade  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
Pork  O
Roulade  O
Set  O
(  O
$  O
42  O
)  O
was  O
straight  O
forward  O
with  O
its  O
strong  O
and  O
intense  O
flavours  O
.  O

Meat  O
lover  O
will  O
adore  O
this  O
dish  O
.  O

Best  O
to  O
go  O
with  O
a  O
bottle  O
of  O
beer  O
.  O

Black  O
Angus  O
Ribeye  O
4.5/5  O

Among  O
the  O
4  O
mains  O
,  O
the  O
Black  O
Angus  O
Ribeye  O
Set  O
(  O
$  O
52  O
)  O
was  O
my  O
favourite  O
for  O
the  O
evening  O
.  O

The  O
meat  O
was  O
grilled  O
to  O
perfection  O
,  O
juicy  O
and  O
flavourful  O
with  O
a  O
tad  O
of  O
smokiness  O
.  O

Tiramisu  O
4/5  O

For  O
the  O
dessert  O
there  O
is  O
a  O
choice  O
of  O
Tiramisu  O
or  O
Creme  O
Brulee  O
.  O

The  O
Tiramisu  O
here  O
is  O
without  O
liqueur  O
and  O
on  O
the  O
cheesy  O
side  O
.  O

I  O
actually  O
quite  O
like  O
this  O
version  O
as  O
I  O
love  O
my  O
cheese  O
.  O

Creme  O
Brulee  O
2.5/5  O

The  O
Creme  O
Brulee  O
was  O
unfortunately  O
not  O
up  O
to  O
expectation  O
.  O

The  O
rich  O
custard  O
base  O
was  O
eggy  O
and  O
lacked  O
the  O
vanilla  O
flavour  O
.  O

The  O
layer  O
of  O
hard  O
caramel  O
sunk  O
in  O
instead  O
of  O
crackling  O
when  O
I  O
dug  O
my  O
spoon  O
into  O
it  O
.  O

I  O
love  O
to  O
eat  O
steamboat  O
because  O
it  O
is  O
a  O
joy  O
to  O
be  O
eating  O
with  O
a  O

of  O
people  O
together  O
with  O
lots  O

several  O

a  O
more  O
fiery  O
kick  O
,  O
the  O

Although  O
the  O

I  O
find  O
it  O
a  O

mushroom  O
and  O
bread  O
chips  O
served  O
with  O
glazed  O
carrots  O
and  O
Senso  O
puree  O
.  O

Although  O
I  O
like  O
the  O
texture  O
of  O
the  O
beef  O
cheek  O
,  O
the  O
flavour  O
of  O
the  O
whole  O
dish  O
was  O
abit  O
too  O
heavy  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

The  O
nature  O
flavour  O
of  O
the  O
beef  O
cheef  O
was  O
overshadowed  O
.  O

Senso  O
Bolo'bster  O
Lasagna  O
4.5/5  O

I  O
took  O
a  O
bite  O
of  O
the  O
Senso  O
Bolo'bster  O
Lasagna  O
(  O
$  O
32  O
)  O
and  O
it  O
was  O
so  O
good.The  O
homemade  O
lasagna  O
with  O
fresh  O
lobster  O
and  O
tomato  O
sauce  O
got  O
me  O
excited  O
as  O
it  O
is  O
something  O
different  O
and  O
new  O
for  O
my  O
palate  O
.  O

A  O
well  O
executed  O
dish  O
with  O
a  O
beautiful  O
balance  O
of  O
flavours  O
and  O
textures  O
.  O

Creme  O
Brulee  O
4/5  O

Interestingly  O
the  O
Creme  O
Brulee  O
(  O
$  O
16  O
)  O
was  O
served  O
in  O
2  O
version  O
,  O
the  O
original  O
and  O
coffee  O
flavours  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
served  O
with  O
strawberry  O
and  O
homemade  O
strawberry  O
sherbet  O
.  O

I  O
really  O
like  O
the  O
coffee  O
flavoured  O
creme  O
brulee  O
which  O
had  O
a  O
nice  O
coffee  O
aroma  O
.  O

The  O
strawberry  O
sherbet  O
was  O
also  O
very  O
fruity  O
and  O
freshing  O
.  O

Chocolate  O

the  O

Cake  O
(  O

18  O
)  O
served  O
with  O
passionfruit  O
and  O
vanilla  O
ice  O
cream  O
was  O
classic  O
but  O
delish  O
.  O

The  O
lave  O
cake  O
was  O
warm  O
and  O
moist  O
like  O
a  O
hot  O
dark  O

Arriving  O
at  O
my  O
destination  O
,  O
I  O
find  O
the  O
place  O
very  O
familiar  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
visited  O
the  O
place  O
with  O
my  O
colleagues  O
sometime  O
back  O
and  O
we  O
did  O
not  O
have  O
a  O
good  O
experience  O
.  O

Upon  O
chatting  O
with  O
the  O
new  O
co-owner  O
,  O
he  O
told  O
me  O
they  O
have  O
taken  O
over  O
from  O
the  O
previous  O
owner  O
and  O
kept  O
most  O
of  O
the  O
decor.They  O
have  O
also  O
renamed  O
it  O
to  O
MooJaa  O
,  O
Mookata  O
Thai  O
BBQ  O
Steamboat  O
and  O
revamped  O
the  O
menu  O
offering  O
more  O
authentic  O
and  O
quality  O
food  O
.  O

Fried  O
Salmon  O
Skin  O

While  O
we  O
waited  O
for  O
the  O
rest  O
of  O
the  O
group  O
to  O
arrive  O
,  O
we  O
were  O
served  O
Fried  O
Salmon  O
Skin  O
.  O

At  O
MooJaa  O
,  O
there  O
is  O
the  O
Seafood  O
dipping  O
sauce  O
and  O
Chilli  O
dipping  O
sauce  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
told  O
that  O
each  O
sauce  O
is  O
made  O
from  O
30  O
different  O
ingredients  O
.  O

I  O
preferred  O
the  O
seafood  O
dipping  O
sauce  O
to  O
the  O
chilli  O
dipping  O
sauce  O
.  O

Dinner  O
was  O
served  O
when  O
everyone  O
arrived.Well  O
not  O
ready  O
,  O
the  O
restaurant  O
has  O
to  O
bring  O
out  O
the  O
charcoal  O
first  O
for  O
the  O
Mookata  O
.  O

At  O
MooJaa  O
,  O
premium  O
charcoal  O
was  O
used  O
.  O

It  O
retains  O
the  O
heat  O
better  O
and  O
there  O
wo  O
n't  O
be  O
ashes  O
flying  O
around  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
sure  O
we  O
do  O
n't  O
want  O
the  O
charcoal  O
ashes  O
to  O
fall  O
on  O
our  O
food  O
and  O
spoilt  O

It  O

comes  O
with  O

while  O
Set  O

comes  O
with  O

Each  O

comes  O
with  O

asprawn  O

An  O
important  O
ingredient  O
for  O
Mookata  O
is  O
Pork  O
Lard  O
.  O

The  O
pork  O
lard  O
is  O
used  O
to  O
oil  O
the  O
metal  O
dome  O

area  O
of  O
the  O

By  O
doing  O
so  O
,  O
it  O
prevents  O
the  O
ingredients  O
from  O
sticking  O
to  O
the  O

.  O

At  O
the  O
same  O
time  O
,  O
cooking  O
the  O
ingredients  O
with  O
the  O
pork  O

oil  O
lift  O
the  O

If  O
the  O

you  O
can  O
also  O

I  O
feel  O
that  O
the  O

have  O
brought  O
back  O
quality  O
in  O
the  O

I  O

the  O

the  O

is  O
steamed  O

rolled  O
in  O

.  O

It  O
is  O
a  O
bit  O
boring  O
to  O
be  O
eating  O
it  O
alone  O
without  O
any  O

I  O

although  O
was  O
huge  O
the  O
proportion  O
of  O

and  O
filling  O
was  O
quite  O
balanced  O
.  O

The  O
disappointment  O
was  O
the  O
lacking  O
of  O
the  O
squirting  O
surprise  O
of  O

when  O
biting  O
into  O
it  O

usually  O

like  O
to  O
dissect  O
it  O

Kueh  O
Salat  O
4/5  O

I  O
guess  O
this  O
is  O
probably  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
more  O
popular  O
Nonya  O
kuehs  O
that  O
everyone  O
is  O
familiar  O
withas  O
it  O
is  O
often  O
available  O
on  O
most  O
buffet  O

.  O

Kueh  O
Salat  O
(  O
$  O
1.20/pkt  O
)  O
is  O
made  O
up  O
of  O
a  O
layer  O
of  O
glutinous  O
rice  O
and  O
kaya  O
custard  O
with  O
a  O

Ubi  O

(  O

a  O

Knowing  O

If  O
you  O
have  O
been  O
to  O
Vietnam  O
,  O
you  O
would  O
probably  O
heard  O
of  O
Wrap  O
&  O
Roll  O
and  O
dine  O
there.I  O
used  O
to  O
travel  O
quite  O
a  O
bit  O
to  O
Ho  O
Chi  O
Minh  O
City  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
years  O
back  O
and  O
I  O
have  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
food  O
at  O
Wrap  O
&  O
Roll  O
which  O
brings  O
to  O
the  O
table  O
authentic  O
Vietnamese  O
cuisine  O
at  O
a  O
relax  O
comtempoary  O
ambience  O
.  O

A  O
couple  O
of  O
weeks  O
back  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
checking  O
out  O
the  O
new  O
Star  O
Vista  O
Mall  O
at  O
Buona  O
Vista  O
and  O
I  O
was  O
deciding  O
where  O
to  O
have  O
lunch  O
when  O
I  O
chanced  O
upon  O
Wrap  O
&  O
Roll  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
glad  O
someone  O
has  O
brought  O
the  O
restaurant  O
to  O
Singapore  O
.  O

Without  O
a  O
doubt  O
,  O
my  O
lunch  O
was  O
decided  O
.  O

and  O
Minced  O
Pork  O

4.2/5  O

Vietnamese  O
cuisine  O
is  O
all  O
about  O
fresh  O
vegetables  O
&  O
herbs  O
,  O
rice  O
paper  O
roll  O
and  O
fish  O
sauce  O
.  O

After  O
2  O
years  O
of  O
research  O
before  O
they  O
opened  O
their  O
first  O
restaurant  O
Feb  O
2006  O
in  O
Vietnam  O
,  O
Wrap  O
&  O
Roll  O
not  O
only  O
brings  O
the  O
4  O
key  O
elements  O
of  O
Vietnamese  O
cuisine  O
to  O
the  O
table  O
but  O
also  O
the  O
different  O
styles  O
of  O
North  O
,  O
Central  O
and  O
South  O
Vietnamese  O
cuisines  O
.  O

Therollsare  O
the  O
star  O
of  O
Wrap  O
&  O
Roll  O
.  O

The  O
Singapore  O
outlet  O
seems  O
to  O
have  O
lesser  O
varieties  O
compared  O
to  O
the  O
Vietnam  O
restaurants  O
.  O

Anyway  O
,  O
I  O
tried  O
the  O
Taste  O
of  O
Hanoi  O
(  O
North  O
Vietnam  O
)  O
rolls  O
(  O
$  O
9.90  O
)  O
.I  O
preferred  O
the  O
fresh  O
vegetables  O
and  O
herbs  O
of  O
the  O
Pho  O
Beef  O
in  O
Steamed  O
Rice  O
Paper  O
Roll  O
to  O
the  O
Minced  O
Pork  O
in  O
Steamed  O
Rice  O
Paper  O
Roll  O
.  O

The  O
latter  O
with  O
the  O
minced  O
pork  O
stuffing  O
and  O
pork  O
floss  O
on  O
top  O
resembles  O
those  O
Chee  O

we  O
have  O
for  O

Grilled  O
Pork  O
Chop  O
Rice  O
with  O
Salted  O
Egg  O
Pudding  O
3.8/5  O

My  O
partner  O
was  O
famished  O
so  O
she  O
ordered  O
the  O
Grilled  O
Pork  O
Chop  O
Rice  O
with  O
Salted  O
Egg  O
Pudding  O
(  O
$  O
12.90  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
grilled  O
pork  O
was  O
beautifully  O
marinated  O
and  O
was  O
very  O
flavourful  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
too  O
dry  O
to  O
our  O
likings  O
.  O

However  O
we  O
loved  O
thesalted  O
egg  O
pudding  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
similar  O
to  O
the  O
Chinese  O
's  O
meatball  O
and  O
there  O
is  O
also  O
chye  O
poh  O
in  O
it  O
.  O

Vietnamese  O
Fish  O
Noodle  O
Soup  O
4.2/5  O

I  O
was  O
looking  O
for  O
something  O
light  O
as  O
I  O
had  O
a  O
heavy  O
breakfast  O
so  O
I  O
ordered  O
the  O
Vietnamese  O
Fish  O
Noodle  O
Soup  O
(  O
$  O
15.90  O
)  O
.  O

I  O
called  O
it  O
the  O
Vietnamese  O
Yong  O
Tau  O
Foo  O
.  O

Therewere  O
ingredients  O
stuffed  O
with  O
fish  O
pastes  O
,  O
fish  O
balls  O
,  O
fish  O
slices  O
and  O
vegetables  O
in  O
it  O
.  O

The  O
Vietnamese  O
rice  O
vermicelli  O
was  O
firm  O
and  O
silky  O
which  O
was  O
very  O
delectable  O
with  O
the  O
light  O
and  O
refreshing  O
soup  O
.  O

Here  O
is  O
a  O
video  O
of  O
Wrap  O

Roll  O

I  O
found  O
online  O
that  O

the  O

was  O
spongy  O
and  O
soft  O
like  O

Yong  O
wanted  O
to  O
create  O
a  O
crab  O
dish  O
that  O
is  O
distinctively  O
Singapore  O
when  O
he  O
opened  O
Majestic  O
Bay  O
.  O

With  O
his  O
love  O
for  O
coffee  O
and  O
a  O
good  O
3  O
months  O
of  O
research  O
,  O
the  O
Bay  O
's  O
Signature  O
``  O
Kopi  O
''  O
Sauce  O
Crab  O
(  O
market  O
price  O
)  O
is  O
born  O
.  O

The  O
special  O
coffee  O
sauce  O
is  O
made  O
from  O
a  O
blend  O
of  O
3  O
different  O
coffee  O
beans  O
.  O

Apple  O
jam  O
was  O
also  O
added  O
to  O
sweeten  O
it  O
.  O

Chinese  O
white  O
wine  O
is  O
poured  O
onto  O
the  O
crab  O
and  O
ignited  O
at  O
the  O
table  O
filling  O
the  O
restaurant  O
with  O
the  O
strong  O
coffee  O
aroma  O
.  O

This  O
probably  O
will  O
be  O
the  O
next  O
iconic  O
crab  O
dish  O
after  O
the  O
chilli  O
crab  O
,  O
black  O
pepper  O
crab  O
and  O
salted  O
egg  O
yolk  O
crab  O
.  O

Another  O
signature  O
dish  O
at  O
Majestic  O
Bay  O
is  O
the  O
Baked  O
Rice  O
with  O
Assorted  O
Seafood  O
(  O
$  O
68/  O
$  O
88  O
)  O
.  O

Served  O
and  O
presented  O
like  O
the  O
Spanish  O
paella  O
,  O
the  O
rice  O
was  O
first  O
fried  O
before  O
baking  O
in  O
cheese  O
.  O

A  O
fusion  O
dish  O
with  O
the  O
abundance  O
of  O
fresh  O
sea  O
treasures  O
and  O
the  O
bold  O
robust  O
flavours  O
got  O
the  O
approval  O
from  O
the  O
group  O
.  O

Sweet  O
Temptation  O
4.2/5  O

Dessert  O
was  O
Sweet  O
Temptation  O
(  O
$  O
20  O
for  O
4  O
pax  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
sweet  O
temptation  O
platter  O
comes  O
with  O
Black  O
Glutinous  O
Rice  O
Dumpling  O
with  O
Shredded  O
Coconut  O
,  O
Glutinous  O
Rice  O
with  O
Fresh  O
Cream  O
Stuffing  O
,  O
Steamed  O
Custard  O
Bun  O
with  O
Salted  O
Egg  O
Yolk  O
and  O
Bay  O
's  O
Chinese  O
Pancake  O
with  O
Red  O
Bean  O
Paste  O
.  O

All  O
4  O
desserts  O
were  O
so  O
good  O
that  O
I  O
ca  O
n't  O
decide  O
which  O
is  O
my  O
favourite  O
.  O

The  O
Black  O
Glutinous  O
Rice  O
Dumpling  O
with  O
Shredded  O
Coconut  O
probably  O
is  O
the  O
more  O
uncommon  O
among  O
all  O
.  O

The  O
black  O
glutinous  O
rice  O
dumping  O
comes  O
with  O
yam  O
paste  O
filling  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
like  O
having  O
both  O
Pulut  O
Hitam  O
and  O
Orh  O
Nee  O
in  O
one  O
dessert  O
.  O

Majestic  O

likely  O
to  O
be  O
a  O
shining  O
star  O
in  O
Singapore  O

scene  O
with  O

Back  O
in  O
October  O
2012  O
,  O
I  O
attended  O
the  O
monthly  O
makansutra  O
dinner  O
which  O
was  O
held  O
at  O
Forture  O
Seafood  O
Steamboat  O
along  O
Bukit  O
Timah  O
Road  O
.  O

I  O
understand  O
from  O
a  O
few  O
of  O
the  O
regulars  O
that  O
this  O
is  O
the  O
2nd  O
time  O
makansutra  O
dinner  O
is  O
held  O
here  O
because  O
the  O
former  O
chef  O
(  O
Ah  O
Loy  O
)  O
has  O
returned  O
to  O
helm  O
the  O
kitchen  O
again  O
.  O

Supreme  O
Dragon  O
&  O
Phoenix  O
Platter  O
4/5  O

The  O
dinner  O
started  O
with  O
the  O
Supreme  O
Dragon  O
&  O
Phoenix  O
Platter  O
.  O

When  O
this  O
was  O
served  O
,  O
everyone  O
on  O
the  O
table  O
was  O
fascinated  O
by  O
the  O
colourful  O
pink  O
and  O
purple  O
sauces  O
.  O

It  O
turned  O
out  O
they  O
were  O
strawberry  O
(  O
pink  O
)  O
and  O
dragon  O
fruit  O
(  O
purple  O
)  O
sauces  O
for  O
the  O
deep  O
fried  O
prawn  O
.  O

The  O
deep  O
fried  O
chicken  O
on  O
the  O
hand  O
was  O
dressed  O
in  O
a  O
lime  O
and  O
lemon  O
sauce  O
topped  O
with  O
sesame  O
.  O

Deep  O
Fried  O
Fresh  O
Mushroom  O
3.5/5  O

The  O
Deep  O
Fried  O
Fresh  O
Mushroom  O
was  O
nicely  O
executed  O
bringing  O
out  O
the  O
nature  O
earthy  O
flavour  O
of  O
the  O
fresh  O
mushroom  O
.  O

Steamed  O
Garoupa  O
in  O
Green  O
Curry  O
Sauce  O
4/5  O

The  O
Steamed  O
Garoupa  O
in  O
Green  O
Curry  O
Sauce  O
was  O
a  O
welcoming  O
different  O
from  O
the  O
usual  O
cooking  O
styles  O
for  O
steamed  O
fish  O
.  O

The  O
fish  O
was  O
steamed  O
perfectly  O
to  O
tender  O
soft  O
and  O
the  O
accompanying  O
green  O
curry  O
sauce  O
was  O
very  O
appetising  O
.  O

Stir-Fried  O
Vegetable  O
with  O
Dried  O
Scallops  O
3/5  O

The  O
Stir-Fried  O
Vegetable  O
with  O
Dried  O
Scallops  O
was  O
the  O
first  O
time  O
I  O
encountered  O
the  O
Qing  O
Long  O
Cai  O
literally  O
translated  O
as  O
Green  O
Dragon  O
Vegetable  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
quite  O
similar  O
to  O
chives  O
but  O
does  O
not  O
taste  O
like  O
it  O
and  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
crunchy  O
texture  O
.  O

The  O
toughness  O
of  O
the  O
dried  O
scallop  O
was  O
a  O
great  O
disappointment  O
which  O
was  O
the  O
downfall  O
of  O
the  O
dish  O
.  O

Salted  O
Baked  O
Chicken  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
comforting  O
kampong  O
styleSalted  O
Baked  O
Chicken  O
was  O
delightful  O
addition  O
to  O
the  O
dinner  O
.  O

However  O
,  O
the  O
star  O
was  O
the  O
minced  O
sand  O
ginger  O
dipping  O
sauce  O
.  O

The  O
chef  O
has  O
specially  O
imported  O
them  O
from  O
Malaysia  O
.  O

Our  O
table  O
was  O
raving  O
about  O
the  O
sauce  O
and  O
the  O
chef  O
was  O
very  O
kind  O
to  O
give  O
us  O
some  O
to  O
bring  O
home  O
.  O

Crispy  O
Duck  O
Roll  O
3.8/5  O

The  O
Crispy  O
Duck  O
Roll  O
was  O
inspired  O
by  O
the  O
popular  O
Beijing  O
Duck  O
.  O

The  O
succulentduck  O
sandwiched  O
between  O
2  O
thin  O
layers  O
of  O
pancake  O
skin  O
was  O
a  O
nice  O
twist  O
by  O
the  O
chef  O
.  O

Braised  O
Herbal  O
Pig  O
Trotter  O
4/5  O

The  O
Braised  O
Herbal  O
Pig  O
Trotter  O
was  O
huge  O
!  O

The  O
meat  O
was  O
tender  O
and  O
fell  O
off  O
the  O
bone  O
with  O
ease  O
.  O

It  O
also  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
herbally  O
taste  O
which  O
was  O
not  O
overpowering  O
.  O

Crispy  O
Hor  O
Fun  O
4/5  O

Which  O
Zi  O
Cha  O
place  O
prepares  O
the  O
Hor  O
Fun  O
this  O
way  O
?  O

I  O
assume  O
ittakes  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
work  O
to  O
fry  O
the  O
hor  O
fun  O
to  O
such  O
a  O
beautiful  O
crisp  O
.  O

The  O
Crispy  O
Hor  O
Fun  O
served  O
together  O
with  O
seafood  O
such  O
as  O
scallops  O
,  O
fish  O
maw  O
and  O
sea  O
cucumberwas  O
is  O
definitely  O
something  O
different  O
from  O
the  O
norm  O
and  O
worth  O
trying  O
.  O

Japanese  O
Sweet  O
Potato  O
4/5  O

Wrapping  O
up  O
the  O
night  O
,  O
we  O
ended  O
our  O
dinner  O
with  O
a  O
Japanese  O
Sweet  O
Potato  O
with  O
sago  O
dessert  O
.  O

For  O
a  O
Zi  O
Char  O
place  O
,  O
I  O
find  O
that  O
Forture  O
Seafood  O
Steamboat  O
is  O
a  O
notch  O
better  O
than  O
most  O
with  O
their  O

in  O
their  O

.  O

For  O
inform  O
,  O
this  O
place  O
is  O
formally  O
known  O
as  O
Fortune  O
Seafood  O
.  O

They  O
dropped  O
the  O
``  O
N  O
''  O
and  O
replaced  O
it  O
with  O
``  O

after  O
fengshui  O

suggested  O
that  O
it  O
is  O
better  O
for  O
their  O
business  O

Back  O
in  O
September  O
2012  O
,  O
I  O
went  O
for  O
a  O
5  O
days  O
trip  O
to  O
Taipei  O
seizing  O
on  O
a  O
1  O
for  O
1  O
Jetstar  O

ticket  O
promotion  O
.  O

Since  O
I  O
have  O
been  O
to  O
Taipei  O
a  O
couple  O
times  O
,  O
I  O
decided  O
to  O
take  O
a  O
train  O
ride  O
down  O
to  O
Hualien  O
to  O
stay  O
at  O
Bayview  O
Hotel  O
(  O
)  O
after  O
seeing  O
all  O
the  O
beautiful  O
photos  O
on  O
my  O
friend  O
's  O
facebook  O
page  O
.  O

Upon  O
our  O
arrival  O
at  O
Hualien  O
train  O
station  O
,  O
the  O
hotel  O
staff  O
picked  O
us  O
up  O
together  O
with  O
another  O
Singaporean  O
couple  O
.  O

The  O
journey  O
from  O
the  O
train  O
station  O
to  O
the  O
hotel  O
took  O
about  O
10  O
minutes  O
.  O

As  O
we  O
were  O
still  O
early  O
for  O
our  O
check  O
in  O
,  O
we  O
went  O
to  O
the  O
hotel  O
's  O
cafe  O
next  O
door  O
to  O
rest  O
and  O
wait  O
for  O
our  O
check  O
in  O
time  O
.  O

We  O
did  O
not  O
explore  O
the  O
area  O
as  O
we  O
were  O
tiredafter  O
a  O
long  O
journey  O
travelling  O
on  O
plane  O
,  O
train  O
and  O
car  O
to  O
the  O
hotel  O
.  O

Stepping  O
into  O
the  O
cafe  O
,  O
it  O
felt  O
as  O
if  O
I  O
am  O
in  O
Greece  O
.  O

Helping  O
ourselves  O
to  O
the  O
free  O
beverage  O
and  O
local  O
snacks  O
while  O
we  O
waited  O
for  O
our  O
check  O
in  O
time  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
our  O
Deluxe  O
Familyroom  O
for  O
4  O
with  O
balcony  O
overlooking  O
the  O
pacific  O
ocean  O
.  O

As  O
the  O
Deluxe  O
Double  O
Room  O
is  O
fully  O
booked  O
,  O
the  O
hotel  O
was  O
very  O
kind  O
to  O
offer  O
me  O
the  O
Deluxe  O
Family  O
Room  O
with  O
thesame  O
rate  O
for  O
the  O
Deluxe  O
Double  O
Room  O
.  O

Simply  O
love  O
the  O
white  O
and  O
tiffany  O
blue  O
combination  O
.  O

This  O
was  O
the  O
view  O
of  O
the  O
Pacific  O
Ocean  O
that  O
greeted  O
me  O
everyday  O
.  O

In  O
the  O
background  O
,  O
that  O
's  O
the  O
fishing  O
boat  O
that  O
will  O
bring  O
in  O
freshly  O
live  O
catch  O
everyday  O
.  O

The  O
viewof  O
the  O
popular  O
beach  O
,  O
Chi  O
Sing  O
Tan  O
(  O
)  O
was  O
just  O
stuning  O
is  O
n't  O
it  O
?  O

Next  O
morning  O
after  O
our  O
breakfast  O
,  O
we  O
rented  O
the  O
free  O
bicycle  O
from  O
the  O
hotel  O
and  O
went  O
biking  O
along  O
the  O
coastal  O
area  O
.  O

We  O
cycled  O
up  O
a  O
hill  O
top  O
to  O
catch  O
the  O
beautiful  O
bird  O
's  O
eye  O
view  O
of  O
the  O
beach  O
.  O

Along  O
the  O
cycling  O
track  O
,  O
we  O
also  O
saw  O
lots  O
of  O
pineapple  O
plantgrowing  O
alongside  O
the  O
track  O
.  O

Moving  O
in  O
shore  O
,  O
there  O
are  O
many  O
interesting  O
buidings  O
spotted  O
too  O
.  O

I  O
really  O
enjoyed  O
my  O
stay  O
at  O
Bayview  O
Hotel  O
at  O
Hualien  O
.  O

The  O
staffs  O
were  O
very  O
friendly  O
and  O
helpful  O
.  O

The  O
room  O
was  O
clean  O
too  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
want  O
to  O
go  O
to  O
Hualien  O
town  O
,  O
the  O
staff  O
can  O
help  O
you  O
arrange  O
a  O
taxifor  O
a  O
fixed  O
fee  O
inclusive  O
of  O
return  O
trip  O
.  O

Upon  O
reaching  O
your  O
destination  O
,  O
tell  O
the  O
taxi  O
driver  O
the  O
time  O
and  O
place  O
to  O
pick  O
you  O
up  O
.  O

You  O
only  O
need  O
to  O
pay  O
the  O
driver  O
after  O
returning  O
back  O
to  O
the  O
hotel  O

If  O
weare  O
to  O
name  O
the  O

,  O
besides  O

one  O

that  O

up  O
by  O
many  O
is  O
Kok  O
Kee  O
Wanton  O
Mee  O
at  O
Lavendar  O
Food  O
Square  O
.  O

A  O
long  O
queue  O
is  O
always  O
spotted  O
in  O
front  O
of  O
the  O
stall  O
and  O
a  O
wait  O
up  O
to  O
10-15  O
minutes  O
is  O
inevitable  O
.  O

So  O
how  O
did  O
the  O
Wanton  O
Mee  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
fare  O
?  O

The  O
char  O
siew  O
and  O
wanton  O
were  O
quite  O
average  O
,  O
nothing  O
astonishing  O
.  O

The  O
reason  O
why  O
the  O
Kok  O
Kee  O
has  O
a  O
faithful  O
followers  O
for  O
their  O
wanton  O
mee  O
all  O
these  O
years  O
has  O
to  O
be  O
the  O
homemade  O
springy  O
noodles  O
and  O
the  O
special  O
sauce  O
that  O
was  O
drenched  O
onto  O
the  O
noodle  O
before  O
servicing  O
.  O

The  O
fantastic  O
harmony  O
of  O
the  O
sauce  O
with  O
the  O
noodles  O
deserved  O
my  O
return  O
again  O

a  O

arrived  O
at  O
the  O

at  O
about  O
145pm  O

After  O
reading  O
reviews  O
about  O
the  O
wasabi  O

,  O
I  O
have  O
been  O
looking  O
forward  O
to  O

it  O
.  O

The  O
Green  O
Spicy  O
Tori  O
King  O
Ramen  O
Special  O
(  O
$  O
16.90  O
)  O
comes  O
with  O
all  O
the  O
toppings  O
(  O
seaweed  O
&  O
flavoured  O
egg  O
)  O
.  O

You  O
can  O
also  O
choose  O
the  O
taste  O
of  O
soup  O
(  O
light/normal/strong  O
)  O
,  O
chicken  O

and  O
texture  O
of  O

(  O

during  O
your  O

as  O
well  O
as  O
the  O
ingredients  O
(  O
spring  O
onion/deep  O
fried  O
onion/black  O
fungus  O
)  O
you  O
do  O
n't  O
want  O
the  O
chef  O
to  O
add  O
into  O
your  O
bowl  O
of  O
ramen  O
.  O

Resting  O
on  O
the  O
chicken  O
thigh  O
was  O
a  O
bed  O
of  O
wasabi  O
.  O

Mixing  O
it  O
with  O
the  O
chicken  O
broth  O
,  O
it  O
gave  O
the  O
broth  O
an  O
unique  O
delectable  O
flavour  O
with  O
a  O
mild  O
wasabi  O
spiciness  O
.  O

The  O
tamago  O
egg  O
was  O
well  O
flavoured  O
and  O
not  O
too  O
salty  O
.  O

Black  O
Spicy  O
Tori  O
King  O
Ramen  O
Special  O
4.2/5  O

Each  O
bowl  O
of  O
ramen  O
comes  O
with  O
the  O
standard  O
gigantic  O
chicken  O
thigh  O
and  O
char  O
siew  O
.  O

The  O
star  O
is  O
defintiely  O
the  O
chicken  O
thigh  O
which  O
was  O
very  O
tender  O
and  O
fell  O
off  O
the  O
bone  O
with  O
ease  O
.  O

The  O
Black  O
Spicy  O
Tori  O
King  O
Ramen  O
(  O
$  O
16.90  O
)  O
comes  O
with  O
toasted  O
szechuan  O
peppercorn  O
and  O
garlic  O
in  O
oil  O
that  O
gave  O
the  O
chicken  O
broth  O
the  O
fragrant  O
toasty  O
aroma  O
.  O

Having  O
tried  O
both  O
Marutama  O
Ramen  O
and  O
Marukin  O
Ramen  O
Tokyo  O
that  O
used  O
chicken  O
stock  O
for  O
their  O
ramen  O
,  O
I  O
think  O
Chef  O
Keisuke  O
Takeda  O
nailed  O
his  O
version  O
.  O

While  O
chicken  O
stock  O
ramen  O
is  O
less  O
oily  O
and  O
lighter  O
,  O
Keisuke  O
Tori  O
King  O
's  O
broth  O
ismore  O
robust  O
.  O

In  O
addition  O
,  O
the  O
generous  O
servicing  O
of  O
chicken  O
thigh  O
and  O
char  O
siew  O
definitely  O
is  O
a  O
crowd  O
winner  O

.  O

Kkhongdon  O
in  O
Korean  O
literally  O
means  O
best  O
price  O
value  O
.  O

The  O
history  O
started  O
back  O
with  O
the  O
first  O
Korean  O
BBQ  O
restaurant  O
in  O
Sinchon  O
,  O
Seoul  O
in  O
January  O
2005  O
.  O

To  O
date  O
there  O
are  O
67  O
outlets  O
in  O
Korea  O
providing  O
high  O
quality  O
Korean  O
BBQ  O
at  O
reasonable  O
price  O
.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
is  O
nicely  O
spaced  O
withextendable  O
air  O
suction  O
pipe  O
.  O

It  O
also  O
has  O
an  O
air  O
purifier  O
placed  O
in  O
corner  O
to  O
freshen  O
the  O
air  O
in  O
the  O
restaurantso  O
customers  O
do  O
not  O
smell  O
like  O
BBQ  O
after  O
dining  O
.  O

Free  O
flow  O
Kimchi  O
and  O
Korean  O
side  O
dishes  O
are  O
available  O
at  O
the  O
buffet  O
counter  O
but  O
rather  O
limited  O
selections  O
.  O

Aaron  O
the  O
restaurant  O
manager  O
cooked  O
us  O
some  O
kimchi  O
and  O
bean  O
sprouts  O
saying  O
that  O
it  O
tasted  O
better  O
when  O
it  O
is  O
warm  O
.  O

Indeed  O
it  O
did  O
and  O
I  O
will  O
do  O
so  O
when  O
I  O
next  O
visit  O
another  O
Korean  O
BBQ  O
restaurant  O
.  O

Raspberry  O
Rice  O
Wine  O
3/5  O

As  O
I  O
wanted  O
to  O
try  O
something  O
different  O
on  O
the  O
beverage  O
menu  O
,  O
Aaron  O
recommended  O
me  O
the  O
Raspberry  O
Rice  O
Wine  O
360ml  O
(  O
$  O
19  O
)  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
I  O
did  O
not  O
know  O
how  O
to  O
appreciate  O
it  O
.  O

I  O
should  O
have  O
just  O
stick  O
to  O
my  O
beer  O
.  O

Beef  O
Skirt  O
4/5  O

Beef  O
Fingers  O
4/5  O

On  O
the  O
beef  O
menu  O
,  O
I  O
tried  O
both  O
the  O
Beef  O
Skirt  O
(  O
$  O
16  O
)  O
and  O
Beef  O
Fingers  O
(  O
$  O
16  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
beef  O
was  O
directly  O
imported  O
from  O
JP  O
Pepperdine  O
's  O
own  O
Silver  O
FernFarmsin  O
New  O

.  O

These  O
are  O
the  O
same  O
beefused  O
for  O
Jack  O
Place  O

.  O

The  O
beef  O
was  O
tender  O
and  O
succulent  O
.  O

Knowing  O
my  O
weakest  O
for  O
Pork  O

(  O
$  O
16  O
)  O
,  O
I  O
would  O
always  O
prefer  O
them  O
over  O
the  O
beef  O
.  O

The  O
beautiful  O
layers  O
of  O
fat  O
and  O
meat  O
when  O
grilled  O
were  O
simply  O
sizzling  O
yummy  O
.  O

spicy  O
version  O
too  O
.  O

The  O
Spicy  O
Pork  O
Belly  O
(  O
$  O
16  O
)  O
was  O
just  O
as  O
good  O
but  O
it  O
wasa  O
bit  O
too  O
mild  O
in  O
the  O
spices  O
.  O

I  O
did  O
not  O
get  O
the  O
hot  O
rush  O
I  O
was  O
expecting  O
.  O

Beside  O
the  O
Korean  O
BBQ  O
,  O
the  O

also  O
offers  O
authentic  O
Korean  O
dishes  O
on  O
the  O

prepared  O
by  O

Korean  O

the  O
Bibimbap  O
was  O
served  O
at  O
the  O
right  O
time  O
to  O
fill  O
my  O
stomach  O
.  O

We  O
asked  O
Aaron  O
how  O
come  O
there  O
was  O
no  O
egg  O
and  O
it  O
was  O
not  O
served  O
in  O

is  O
from  O

Without  O

the  O
rice  O
,  O
the  O
crisp  O
and  O
burnt  O
rice  O

the  O
bottom  O

missingwhich  O

the  O
delectable  O
part  O
of  O
it  O
.  O

Seafood  O
Pancake  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
Seafood  O
Pancake  O
(  O
$  O
12  O
)  O
had  O
a  O
nice  O
thin  O
crust  O
on  O
both  O
the  O
top  O
and  O
bottom  O
while  O
the  O
inside  O
was  O
moist  O
and  O
fluffy.Topped  O
with  O
seafood  O
it  O
was  O
quite  O
a  O
sumptuous  O
pancake  O
.  O

Kimchi  O
Pancake  O
3.8/5  O

For  O
kimchi  O
lover  O
,  O
the  O
Kimchi  O
Pancake  O
(  O
$  O
10.80  O
)  O
is  O
definitely  O
one  O
pancake  O
for  O
you  O
.  O

With  O
a  O
generous  O
amount  O
of  O
kimchi  O
in  O
between  O
the  O
flour  O
batter  O
,  O
each  O
bite  O
of  O
the  O
crunchy  O
kimchi  O
inside  O
was  O
an  O
enjoyment  O
.  O

Ginseng  O
Chicken  O
4/5  O

It  O
was  O
a  O
cold  O
night  O
and  O
the  O
Ginseng  O
Chicken  O
(  O
$  O
18  O
)  O
was  O
perfect  O
for  O
warming  O
the  O
body  O
.  O

A  O
well  O
executed  O
dish  O
that  O
was  O
hearty  O
and  O
comforting  O
.  O

If  O
I  O
want  O
to  O
be  O
picky  O
,  O
the  O
soup  O
was  O
lacking  O
the  O
ginseng  O
flavour  O
.  O

Kimchi  O
and  O
Pork  O
Belly  O
Stew  O
Hotpot  O
4.5/5  O

The  O
Kimchi  O
and  O
Pork  O
Belly  O
Stew  O
Hotpot  O
(  O
$  O
22  O
)  O
is  O
the  O
most  O
popular  O
Korean  O
dish  O
.  O

The  O
well  O
fermented  O
kimchi  O
with  O
tasty  O
pork  O
belly  O
worked  O
harmoniously  O
in  O
the  O
bowl  O
of  O
spicy  O
broth  O
.  O

Besides  O
the  O
soft  O
and  O
tender  O
pork  O
belly  O
,  O
the  O
hotpot  O
also  O
comes  O
with  O
soft  O
and  O
silky  O
tofu  O
.  O

Steamed  O
Egg  O
4/5  O

The  O
Steamed  O
Egg  O
(  O
$  O
6  O
)  O
was  O
quite  O
flavourful  O
with  O
custard  O
like  O
texture  O
topped  O
with  O
scallions  O
and  O
carrots  O
.  O

I  O
could  O
n't  O
tellwhat  O
's  O
the  O
broth  O
used  O
to  O
thin  O
the  O
egg  O
mixture  O
but  O
it  O
definitely  O
lifted  O
the  O
taste  O
and  O
dimension  O
of  O
this  O
humble  O
dish  O
.  O

Overall  O
I  O
think  O
Kkongdon  O
Korean  O
BBQ  O
is  O
worth  O
a  O
visit  O
with  O
good  O
quality  O
meat  O
.  O

On  O
top  O
of  O
that  O
,  O
there  O
are  O
a  O
good  O
selection  O
of  O
authentic  O
Korean  O
dishes  O
.  O

It  O
would  O
be  O
nice  O
if  O
they  O
can  O
expand  O
the  O
selection  O
of  O
free  O
flow  O
kimchi  O
and  O
side  O
dishes  O
.  O

I  O
still  O
left  O
the  O
restaurant  O
smelling  O
of  O
BBQ  O
so  O
it  O
probably  O
need  O
to  O
install  O
a  O
few  O
more  O
air  O
purifiers  O

Reflectingon  O
the  O
Makan  O
Gathering  O
on  O
03  O
November  O
2012  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
an  O
event  O
that  O
was  O
filled  O
with  O
lots  O
of  O
different  O
emotions  O
.  O

Both  O
Maureen  O
and  O
me  O
were  O
so  O
stress  O
leading  O
up  O
to  O
the  O
event  O
that  O
we  O
have  O
sleepless  O
nights  O
and  O
kept  O
askingeach  O
otherwhether  O
we  O
will  O
ever  O
do  O
it  O
again  O
?  O

I  O
will  O
leave  O
the  O
answer  O
to  O
the  O
end  O
of  O
the  O
post  O
cause  O
we  O
ourselves  O
said  O
this  O
to  O
each  O
other  O
,  O
``  O
ask  O
me  O
again  O
after  O
the  O
event  O
''  O
.  O

Those  O
that  O
follow  O
our  O
blogs  O
will  O
know  O
that  O
we  O
organised  O
regular  O
makan  O
trails  O
and  O
the  O
latest  O
was  O
a  O
hawker  O
trail  O
to  O
Tiong  O
Bahru  O
Market  O
and  O
Food  O
Centre  O
.  O

Usually  O
these  O
makan  O
gatherings  O
were  O
kept  O
to  O
a  O
closely  O
knitted  O
group  O
of  O
friends  O
and  O
a  O
manageable  O
size  O
of  O
20-30  O
pax  O
.  O

However  O
,  O
for  O
this  O
makan  O
gathering  O
,  O
we  O
made  O
a  O
brave  O
decision  O
to  O
open  O
it  O
up  O
to  O
EVERYONE  O
.  O

Through  O
one  O
of  O
our  O
tasting  O
sessions  O
,  O
we  O
get  O
to  O
know  O
Kennie  O
from  O
High  O
Societyand  O
we  O
thought  O
maybe  O
we  O
can  O
do  O
a  O
sit  O
down  O
dinner  O
instead  O
of  O
the  O
usual  O
hawker  O
trails  O
.  O

Kennie  O
was  O
very  O
receptive  O
and  O
supportive  O
of  O
our  O
idea  O
and  O
a  O
menu  O
was  O
soon  O
drawn  O
upfora  O
fix  O
price  O
of  O
$  O
35  O
per  O
pax  O
.  O

The  O
initial  O
plan  O
was  O
to  O
limit  O
the  O
makan  O
gathering  O
to  O
40  O
pax  O
but  O
as  O
we  O
sent  O
out  O
the  O
invites  O
on  O
facebook  O
,  O
we  O
realized  O
we  O
got  O
to  O
know  O
so  O
many  O
wonderful  O
friends  O
along  O
our  O
blogging  O
journey  O
and  O
we  O
ended  O
up  O
with  O
70+  O
pax  O
in  O
our  O
invitation  O
.  O

Very  O
soon50+  O

,  O

Mansion  O
on  O
03  O
November  O
2012  O
.  O

Worried  O
that  O
we  O
may  O
not  O
be  O
able  O
to  O
be  O
a  O
good  O
host  O
,  O
we  O
decided  O
to  O
bring  O
in  O
sponsors  O
so  O
everyone  O
has  O
something  O
to  O
bring  O
backfor  O
coming  O

Makan  O
Gathering  O
.  O

We  O

for  O
the  O

.  O

Thank  O
you  O
Faith  O
,  O
Daniel  O
and  O
Karen  O
too  O
.  O

As  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
from  O
the  O
photo  O
above  O
,  O
these  O
were  O
the  O
boxes  O
of  O
goodies  O
we  O
need  O
to  O
transport  O
to  O
the  O
venue  O
.  O

The  O
honey  O
weights  O
1KG  O
and  O
there  O
were  O
60  O
bottles  O
=  O
60KG  O
!  O

These  O
could  O
not  O
be  O
possible  O
without  O
the  O
help  O
from  O
Sherie  O
,  O
Yancai  O
and  O
Chuan  O
Kai  O
.  O

Both  O
Maureen  O
and  O
me  O
came  O
out  O
from  O
out  O
own  O
pockets  O
to  O
get  O
the  O
paper  O
bag  O
for  O
the  O
goodies  O
as  O
we  O
could  O
not  O
find  O
sponsor  O
for  O
it  O
.  O

Each  O
bag  O
cost  O
us  O
$  O
1  O
and  O
we  O
have  O
to  O
spend  O
$  O
60  O
getting  O
them  O
.  O

The  O
worst  O
nightmare  O
was  O
the  O
paper  O
bag  O
could  O
not  O
hold  O
the  O
weight  O
of  O
the  O
goodies  O
and  O
we  O
ended  O
up  O
have  O
a  O
few  O
broken  O

bottles  O
.  O

Thank  O
goodness  O
no  O
one  O
was  O
hurt  O
and  O
we  O
apologize  O
for  O
the  O
unfortunate  O
incident  O

50  O
plastic  O

Even  O
Maureen  O
did  O
not  O
know  O
aboutthis  O
as  O
I  O
composite  O
this  O
paragraph  O
.  O

Since  O

was  O
the  O
only  O
one  O

arrived  O
early  O
to  O

work  O
cause  O
she  O
was  O
held  O
up  O
by  O
traffic  O
transporting  O
the  O
goodies  O
,  O
I  O
had  O
a  O
meeting  O
with  O
the  O
restaurant  O
manager  O
on  O
the  O
flow  O
of  O
the  O
serve  O

major  O
role  O
intaking  O

order  O
,  O
tallying  O
them  O

for  O
me  O
to  O
communicate  O
to  O
the  O
restaurant  O
manager  O
and  O
hence  O

I  O
applauded  O

Similar  O
toSogurt  O

to  O
the  O

Cereal  O
Fries  O
4/5  O

The  O
Cereal  O
Fries  O
was  O
the  O
most  O
interesting  O
to  O
me  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
not  O
tried  O
anything  O
like  O
it  O
before  O
.  O

It  O
tasted  O
nothing  O
like  O
fries  O
yet  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
pretty  O
good  O
in  O
its  O
own  O
unique  O
taste  O
and  O
texture  O
.  O

Our  O
host  O
told  O
us  O
that  O
some  O
people  O
felt  O
that  O
it  O
was  O
too  O
sweet  O
but  O
I  O
did  O
n't  O
think  O
so  O
.  O

Sweet  O
Potato  O
Fries  O
3.8/5  O

The  O
Sweet  O
Potato  O
Fries  O
was  O
more  O
familiar  O
to  O
the  O
palate  O
.  O

The  O
straight  O
cut  O
sweet  O
potato  O
fries  O
nature  O
sweetness  O
would  O
always  O
be  O
my  O
preferred  O
choice  O
over  O
the  O
normal  O
potato  O
fries  O
.  O

Some  O
of  O
the  O
popular  O

resembles  O
the  O
Chinese  O

.  O

The  O
Sirloin  O
steak  O
was  O
grilled  O
to  O

.  O

The  O
meat  O
itself  O
was  O
already  O
succulent  O

nice  O
to  O

green  O
kiwi  O
and  O
not  O
yellow  O
kiwi  O
,  O
also  O
choose  O
one  O
that  O
is  O
not  O
too  O
ripe  O
so  O
that  O
the  O
kiwi  O
will  O
not  O
be  O
too  O
mushy  O
after  O
steaming  O
.  O

Steamed  O
Fish  O
with  O
Green  O
Kiwi  O

Simply  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
taste  O
and  O
flavour  O
of  O
the  O

.  O

The  O
green  O
kiwi  O
after  O
steaming  O
will  O
have  O
a  O

flavour  O
similar  O
to  O

(  O
salted  O
)  O
plum  O
commonly  O
used  O
for  O

.  O

If  O
you  O
like  O
it  O
to  O
be  O
more  O
sour  O
,  O
you  O
can  O
add  O
a  O
few  O
slices  O
of  O

for  O

The  O

introduced  O
us  O

4/5  O

The  O
Mentai  O
Salmon  O
Takana  O
Roll  O
(  O
$  O
18.80  O
)  O
is  O
a  O
reverse  O
sushi  O
roll  O
with  O
the  O
Japanese  O
preserved  O
mustard  O
leaf  O
and  O
salmon  O
wrapping  O
around  O
the  O
spicy  O
seasoned  O
cod  O
roe  O
,  O
sweet  O
omelette  O
and  O
cucumber  O
was  O
an  O
enjoyment  O
both  O
in  O
visual  O
and  O
taste  O
.  O

The  O
Japanese  O
preserved  O
mustard  O
leaf  O

gave  O
the  O
roll  O
a  O
nice  O
crunchy  O
texture  O
.  O

MentaiCheese  O
Chigiri  O
Age  O
3/5  O

Initally  O
I  O
thought  O
the  O
Mentai  O
Cheese  O
Chigiri  O
Age  O
(  O
$  O
9.80  O
)  O
was  O
chicken  O
bites  O
but  O
they  O
were  O
actually  O
fishcake  O
of  O
spicy  O
seasoned  O
cod  O
roe  O
and  O
cheese  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
something  O
I  O
would  O
not  O
usually  O
find  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
or  O
ordered  O
in  O
a  O
Japanese  O
restaurant  O
.  O

This  O
was  O
quite  O
pedestrian  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

The  O

and  O
more  O
compact  O
with  O
its  O
filling  O
.  O

The  O
pan  O
fried  O
bite  O
size  O
Berkshire  O
pork  O
dumplings  O
was  O
filled  O
with  O
cabbage  O
,  O
chives  O
and  O
garlic  O
.  O

Even  O
though  O
the  O
gyoza  O
was  O
pan  O
fried  O
,  O
themeat  O
in  O
thefilling  O
was  O
tender  O
and  O
moist  O
.  O

Probably  O
the  O
best  O
Gyoza  O
I  O
ever  O
had  O
.  O

Shiokoji  O
is  O
a  O

.  O

The  O
Shiokoji  O
Moriawase  O
(  O
$  O
15.80  O
)  O
was  O
an  O
eye  O
opener  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

The  O
chef  O
demonstrated  O
how  O
by  O
controlling  O
the  O
amount  O
of  O
shiokoji  O
can  O
bring  O
out  O
different  O
flavours  O
and  O
tastes  O
of  O
the  O
ingredients  O
.  O

On  O
the  O
platter  O
,  O

itself  O

the  O

to  O
bring  O
the  O
teahouse  O
concept  O
to  O

1989  O
,  O
the  O
original  O
Mouth  O
Restaurant  O
(  O

at  O
Chinatown  O

had  O

hours  O
to  O

the  O

the  O
Cha  O

Salad  O
(  O

was  O
something  O
different  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
it  O
resembled  O
the  O

It  O
can  O
be  O
a  O

to  O
lift  O
the  O

We  O
got  O
to  O
try  O
3  O
types  O
of  O
tea  O
namely  O
Silver  O
Tea  O
Leaf  O
(  O
)  O
,  O
Imperial  O
Huangjin  O
Gui  O
(  O
)  O
and  O
Da  O
Hong  O
Pao  O
(  O
)  O
.  O

Very  O
interestingly  O
,  O
each  O
tea  O
leaf  O
has  O
a  O
legendary  O
story  O
behind  O
it  O
.  O

Takefor  O
example  O
theDa  O
Hong  O
Pao  O
(  O
)  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
about  O
a  O
topscholar  O
who  O
protected  O
the  O
tea  O
tree  O
with  O
his  O
red  O
robe  O
in  O
a  O
stormy  O
night  O
.  O

He  O
was  O
back  O
to  O
the  O
temple  O
to  O
express  O
his  O
thanks  O
to  O
the  O
abbot  O
who  O
took  O
care  O
of  O
him  O
when  O
he  O
fell  O
sick  O
on  O
his  O
way  O
to  O
the  O
imperial  O
exam  O
.  O

The  O
abbot  O
brewed  O
a  O
cup  O
of  O
tea  O
for  O
him  O
to  O
drink  O
and  O
he  O
soon  O
recovered  O
.  O

Eventually  O
took  O
his  O
exam  O
and  O
became  O
top  O
scholar  O
that  O
year  O
.  O

Besides  O
the  O
art  O
of  O
tea  O
brewing  O
,  O
we  O
were  O
also  O
learnt  O
about  O
postures  O
and  O
the  O
ways  O
of  O
hold  O
the  O
tea  O
cup  O
between  O
male  O
and  O
female  O
.  O

Above  O
pictures  O
are  O
the  O
way  O
how  O
the  O
male  O
should  O
be  O
holding  O
the  O
tea  O
cup  O
.  O

And  O
above  O
is  O
how  O
the  O
female  O
holds  O
the  O
tea  O
cup  O
.  O

As  O
you  O
can  O
read  O
,  O
I  O
am  O
not  O
well  O
versed  O
in  O
the  O
art  O
and  O
culture  O
of  O
tea  O
appreciation  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
are  O
interested  O
in  O
tea  O
appreciation  O
,  O
you  O
can  O
drop  O

tea  O

less  O
sweet  O
and  O
had  O
a  O
hint  O
of  O
spiciness  O
to  O

which  O
was  O

and  O
the  O
meat  O
was  O
so  O
soft  O
that  O
it  O
melted  O
in  O
my  O
mouth  O
.  O

The  O
unique  O
name  O
came  O
from  O
the  O
tendency  O
of  O
the  O
fish  O
turning  O
white  O
as  O
milk  O
when  O
it  O
is  O
cooked  O
and  O
its  O

were  O

the  O

usually  O

MakeShake  O
is  O
the  O
first  O
and  O
only  O
customizable  O
premium  O
milkshake  O
concept  O
in  O
Singapore  O
.  O

The  O
kiosk  O
is  O
located  O
at  O
basement  O
2  O
of  O
City  O
Square  O
Mall  O
.  O

Started  O
almost  O
a  O
year  O
back  O
at  O
its  O
new  O
location  O
,  O
I  O
only  O
get  O
to  O
try  O
recent  O
in  O
a  O
meet  O
up  O
with  O
Melissa  O
and  O
Celes  O
after  O
their  O
tasting  O
session  O
nearby  O
.  O

SuperNana  O
and  O
Mangro  O
Zilla  O

The  O
concept  O
is  O
pretty  O
simple  O
like  O
ABC  O
with  O

simple  O
steps  O

However  O
,  O
it  O
took  O
both  O
Celes  O
and  O
me  O
quite  O
a  O
long  O
while  O
to  O
decide  O
because  O
there  O
werejust  O
too  O
many  O
combinations  O
that  O
we  O
can  O
mix  O
and  O
match  O
with  O
.  O

For  O
those  O
like  O
us  O
that  O
could  O
n't  O
decide  O
what  O
to  O
order  O
,  O
worry  O
not  O
as  O
MakeShake  O

I  O

SuperNana  O

)  O
which  O
is  O
a  O

Froyo  O

with  O

.  O

The  O
milkshake  O
was  O
not  O
as  O
sweet  O
compare  O
to  O
most  O
and  O
it  O
had  O
a  O
nice  O
natural  O
flavours  O
of  O
the  O
strawberry  O
and  O
banana  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
back  O
at  O
the  O
Liang  O
Court  O
Shopping  O
Centre  O
with  O
my  O
girl  O
to  O
use  O
the  O
remaining  O
of  O
our  O
vouchers  O
after  O
the  O
Japan  O
Gourmet  O
Journey  O
at  O
Liang  O
Court  O
Shopping  O
Centre  O
.  O

We  O
decided  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
Shabu  O
No  O
Koya  O
since  O
we  O
did  O
n't  O
get  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
other  O
time  O
.  O

We  O
order  O
the  O
Wagyu  O
Beef  O
and  O
Kurobuta  O
Pork  O
Shabu  O
Shabu  O
Set  O
.  O

Interestingly  O
the  O
restaurant  O
uses  O
large  O
Kaminabe  O
Paper  O
to  O
hold  O
the  O
soup  O
.  O

These  O
Kaminabe  O
Paper  O
is  O
from  O
Japan  O
and  O
absorbs  O
impurities  O
from  O
the  O
meat  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
quite  O
amazing  O
that  O
the  O
Kaminabe  O
Paper  O
can  O
stay  O
intact  O
after  O
all  O
the  O
boilng  O
and  O
cooking  O
.  O

Kurobuta  O
Pork  O

Wagyu  O
Beef  O

Both  O
the  O
Kurobuta  O
Pork  O
and  O
Wagyu  O
Beef  O
were  O
beautiful  O
but  O
I  O
thought  O
they  O
were  O
too  O
thinly  O
sliced  O
for  O
textural  O
enjoyment  O
.  O

The  O
soup  O
was  O
rather  O
bland  O
but  O
after  O
all  O
the  O
vegetables  O
were  O
brought  O
to  O
a  O
boil  O
,  O
it  O
will  O
be  O
sweeten  O
.  O

Shabu  O
Shabu  O
4/5  O

The  O
lovely  O
and  O
hearty  O
dinner  O
however  O
was  O
spolit  O
by  O
some  O
unexpected  O
experience  O
.  O

First  O
of  O
all  O
,  O
the  O
restaurant  O
ran  O
out  O
of  O
rice  O
at  O
7pm  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
a  O
bit  O
absurd  O
considermost  O
of  O
the  O
walk  O
in  O
customers  O
asked  O
for  O
rice  O
and  O
some  O
even  O
walked  O
away  O
when  O
told  O
no  O
more  O
rice  O
is  O
served  O
.  O

Why  O
ca  O
n't  O
they  O
cook  O
some  O
rice  O
since  O
it  O
was  O
still  O
early  O
from  O
closing  O
.  O

There  O
is  O
even  O
supermarket  O
just  O
down  O
the  O
corridor  O
.  O

We  O
could  O
see  O
that  O
a  O
few  O
customers  O
were  O
quite  O
upset  O
when  O
they  O
could  O
n't  O
have  O
another  O
refill  O
that  O
include  O
myself  O
.  O

We  O
also  O
have  O
a  O
little  O
commotion  O
who  O
I  O
think  O
is  O
the  O
restaurant  O
manager  O
.  O

She  O
was  O
trying  O
to  O
discourage  O
us  O
from  O
using  O
the  O
voucher  O
although  O
they  O
participated  O
in  O
the  O
Japan  O
Gourmet  O
Journey  O
week  O
organised  O
by  O
the  O
shopping  O
centre  O
,  O
saying  O
it  O
is  O
hard  O
for  O
them  O
to  O
claim  O
from  O
the  O
mall  O
's  O
management  O
.  O

In  O
the  O
end  O
we  O
just  O
gave  O
her  O
the  O
vouchers  O
and  O
left  O
since  O
she  O
claimed  O
that  O
the  O
most  O
she  O
treated  O
it  O
as  O
if  O
we  O
had  O
a  O
free  O
meal  O

the  O
Group  O
's  O
first  O
artistic  O
restaurant  O
celebrates  O
its  O
10anniversary  O
this  O
year  O
.  O

While  O
waiting  O
for  O
all  O
the  O
bloggers  O
to  O
arrive  O
,  O
we  O
were  O
served  O
a  O
delectabe  O
trio  O
of  O
canapes  O
that  O
showcased  O
the  O
artistic  O
endeavour  O
reflected  O
in  O
My  O
Humble  O
House  O
's  O
cuisine  O
,  O
design  O
,  O
service  O
and  O
attention  O
to  O
detail  O
.  O

Popping  O
the  O
Vietnamese  O
Roll  O
canape  O
into  O
the  O
mouth  O
came  O
with  O
abundance  O
of  O
freshness  O
with  O
a  O
light  O
delectable  O
sauce  O
that  O
married  O
everything  O
together  O
.  O

Chicken  O
rice  O
as  O
a  O
canape  O
is  O
a  O
first  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
amazedthat  O
ourlocal  O
delicacy  O
can  O
be  O
presented  O
exquisitely  O
as  O
a  O
sushi  O
canape  O
.  O

The  O
canape  O
even  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
dash  O
of  O
chicken  O
rice  O
chilli  O
sauce  O
that  O
completes  O
the  O
whole  O
meal  O
of  O
chicken  O
rice  O
.  O

The  O
Siew  O
Mai  O
canape  O
was  O
probably  O
the  O
favourite  O
amongthe  O
bloggers  O
.  O

The  O
balance  O
of  O
texture  O
and  O
flavour  O
with  O
a  O
hint  O
of  O
XO  O
sauce  O
was  O
lovely  O
executed  O
.  O

Next  O
up  O
we  O
have  O
Senior  O
Executive  O
Chef  O
Ken  O
Ling  O
and  O
Executive  O
Chef  O
David  O
Liew  O
demonstrated  O
to  O
us  O
2  O
winning  O
dishes  O
at  O
this  O
year  O
Epicurean  O
Star  O
Award  O
.  O

Uniquely  O
TungLok  O
,  O
this  O
is  O
the  O
first  O
time  O
I  O
have  O
seen  O
and  O
triedBlack  O
Sesame  O
Crepe  O
.  O

The  O
first  O
dish  O
prepared  O
by  O
the  O
2  O
executive  O
chefs  O
was  O
Pan-seared  O
Maotai  O
Wine-marinated  O
Chicken  O
stuffed  O
with  O
Foie  O
Gras  O
wrapped  O
in  O
Black  O
Sesame  O
Crepe  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O
thigh  O
,  O
chicken  O
breast  O
meat  O
paste  O
and  O
foie  O
gras  O
were  O
molded  O
into  O
a  O
rectangle  O
shape  O
before  O
being  O
pan-seared  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
then  O
placed  O
on  O
top  O
of  O
the  O
homemade  O
black  O
sesame  O
crepe  O
with  O
romaine  O
lettuce  O
,  O
cripsy  O
beancurd  O
skin  O
,  O
leek  O
,  O
ginger  O
flower  O
,  O
peanut  O
crumbs  O
,  O
black  O
sesame  O
and  O
mustard  O
glazed  O
suckling  O
pig  O
sauce  O
.  O

After  O
the  O
demonstration  O
,  O
we  O
were  O
giving  O
the  O
ingredients  O
to  O
plate  O
it  O
ourself  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
my  O
version  O
of  O
the  O
Pan-seared  O
Maotai  O
Wine-marinated  O
Chicken  O
stuffed  O
with  O
Foie  O
Gras  O
wrapped  O
in  O
Black  O
Sesame  O
Crepe  O
.  O

My  O
girlfriend  O
who  O
does  O
not  O
take  O
foie  O
gras  O
commented  O
that  O
it  O
did  O
not  O
come  O
with  O
the  O
acquire  O
taste  O
and  O
she  O
was  O
happy  O
to  O
finish  O
everything  O
.  O

I  O
applauded  O
the  O
creativity  O
of  O
the  O
black  O
sesame  O
crepe  O
which  O
was  O
soft  O
,  O
smooth  O
and  O
fragrant  O
.  O

The  O
secondwinning  O
dish  O
the  O
two  O
chefs  O
put  O
together  O
for  O
us  O
was  O
the  O
Soft  O
Red  O
Bean  O
Banana  O
Ball  O
coated  O
in  O
Shredded  O
Coconut  O
served  O
on  O
Chilled  O
Tropical  O
Fruits  O
with  O
Crushed  O
Coconut-flavoured  O
Ice  O
with  O
Gula  O
Melaka  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
a  O
surprisingly  O
long  O
name  O
for  O
a  O
dish  O
considering  O
the  O
chinese  O
name  O
for  O
the  O
dish  O
only  O
has  O
7  O
characters  O
,  O
.  O

The  O
rice  O
ball  O
or  O
rice  O
dumpling  O
in  O
the  O
middle  O
of  O
the  O
coconut  O
husk  O
bowl  O
was  O
stuffed  O
with  O
banana  O
cubes  O
and  O
red  O
bean  O
paste  O
.  O

The  O
lovely  O
dessert  O
was  O
like  O
compact  O
coconut  O
platter  O
.  O

The  O
coconut  O
ice  O
cream  O
was  O
made  O
from  O
pure  O
coconut  O
juice  O
,  O
coconut  O
milk  O
,  O
pandan  O
leaf  O
and  O
sugar  O
bringing  O
it  O
to  O
a  O
boil  O
until  O
mixture  O
thicken  O
and  O
refrigerate  O
for  O
8  O
hours  O
.  O

The  O
coconut  O
flesh  O
was  O
also  O
deep  O
fry  O
to  O
crispy  O
to  O
give  O
texture.The  O
chef  O
also  O
painstakingly  O
removed  O
the  O
husk  O
making  O
it  O
into  O
a  O
bowl  O
so  O
customers  O
canenjoy  O
the  O
coconut  O
fresh  O
with  O
ease  O
.  O

When  O
the  O
management  O
asked  O
me  O
whether  O
I  O
have  O
visited  O
My  O
Humble  O
House  O
,  O
I  O
felt  O
bad  O
that  O
I  O
have  O
not  O
visited  O
the  O
restaurant  O
considering  O
it  O
is  O
into  O
its  O
10  O
anniversary  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
very  O
impressed  O
with  O
the  O
effort  O
behind  O
each  O
dish  O
and  O
the  O
artistic  O
presentation  O
of  O
them  O
.  O

Attention  O
to  O
details  O
were  O
also  O
put  O
into  O
each  O
dish  O
.  O

My  O
Humble  O
House  O
definitely  O
will  O
be  O
on  O
my  O

Compared  O
to  O
the  O

,  O
the  O
Thai  O
Papaya  O
Salad  O
was  O
more  O

came  O
with  O
a  O
fearsome  O
kick  O
of  O

.  O

Like  O
the  O

the  O
Thai  O

was  O
given  O
a  O
little  O
twist  O
by  O
the  O
kitchen  O
of  O
Plaza  O

.  O

The  O
lightly  O
breaded  O
version  O
of  O

The  O
Thai  O
Fish  O

and  O
savoury  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
servedright  O
in  O
time  O
to  O
cool  O
off  O
my  O
palate  O
after  O
having  O
all  O

However  O
,  O

among  O

with  O

did  O
not  O

may  O
sound  O
weird  O
to  O
have  O
roast  O
duck  O
meat  O
in  O

it  O
was  O
surprisingly  O

calling  O
out  O
for  O
a  O
plate  O

Once  O

I  O
am  O
not  O
a  O

lover  O
because  O
I  O
always  O
find  O
them  O
too  O
sweet  O
,  O
dry  O
and  O
kind  O
of  O
boring  O
.  O

Kennie  O
from  O

definitely  O
has  O
converted  O
me  O
with  O
the  O

Three  O
factors  O
why  O
I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
cupcakes  O
at  O
High  O
Society  O
so  O
much  O
.  O

The  O
cupcakes  O
were  O
not  O
overly  O
sweet  O
,  O
they  O
were  O
moist  O
and  O
each  O
cupcake  O
comes  O
with  O
an  O
element  O
of  O
surprise  O
in  O
it  O
.  O

Take  O
for  O
example  O
biting  O
into  O
the  O
red  O

came  O
with  O
surprises  O
of  O

in  O

Back  O
in  O
July  O
2012  O
,  O
I  O
blogged  O
about  O
my  O
Japanese  O
Gourmet  O
Journey  O
at  O
Liang  O
Court  O
Shopping  O
Court  O
with  O
my  O
girlfriend  O
and  O
lovely  O
friends  O
(  O
Celes  O
,  O
Charlene  O
and  O
Zhihao  O
)  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
a  O
long  O
and  O
tiring  O
day  O
.  O

We  O
were  O
all  O
famished  O
by  O
dinner  O
time  O
.  O

It  O
did  O
n't  O
help  O
when  O
the  O
restaurants  O
we  O
wanted  O
to  O
visit  O
were  O
all  O
full  O
and  O
we  O
needed  O
to  O
wait  O
for  O
a  O
table  O
.  O

Cutting  O
the  O
story  O
short  O
,  O
we  O
ended  O
up  O
dining  O
at  O
Nirai  O
Kanai  O
Okinawan  O
Restaurant  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
recently  O
watched  O
a  O
food  O
documentary  O
show  O
and  O
I  O
got  O
to  O
know  O
that  O
Okinawan  O
cuisine  O
has  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
influence  O
from  O
the  O
Chinese  O
and  O
Southeast  O
Asian  O
cuisines  O
due  O
to  O
trade  O
in  O
the  O
early  O
dates  O
.  O

In  O
addition  O
,  O
due  O
to  O
the  O
difference  O
in  O
culture  O
,  O
climate  O
,  O
vegetables  O
and  O
other  O
ingredients  O
between  O
Okinawan  O
and  O
mainland  O
Japan  O
,  O
Okinawan  O
cuisine  O
is  O
different  O
from  O
mainland  O
Japanese  O
cuisine  O
.  O

Crispy  O
River  O
Shrimp  O
4/5  O

We  O
started  O
with  O
some  O
bites  O
and  O
starters  O
while  O
we  O
waited  O
for  O
our  O
mains  O
to  O
be  O
served  O
.  O

The  O
Crispy  O
River  O
Shrimp  O
(  O
$  O
8  O
)  O
was  O
suggested  O
by  O
Zhihao  O
who  O
has  O
it  O
before  O
.  O

Really  O
interesting  O
crispy  O
bites  O
with  O
a  O
tad  O
of  O
saltiness  O
.  O

Be  O
warned  O
to  O
be  O
careful  O
while  O
eating  O
these  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
not  O
careful  O
and  O
the  O
claw  O
got  O
stuck  O
into  O
my  O
gum  O
and  O
I  O
have  O
a  O
hard  O
time  O
removing  O
it  O
.  O

Vinegared  O
Mozuku  O
Seaweed  O
3.8/5  O

Initially  O
I  O
wanted  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
Green  O
Caviar  O
Seaweed  O
or  O
known  O
as  O
Sea  O
Grapes  O
but  O
they  O
did  O
not  O
have  O
stock  O
that  O
day  O
.  O

Hence  O
we  O
ended  O
up  O
having  O
the  O
Vinegared  O
Mozuku  O
Seaweed  O
(  O
$  O
8  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
seaweed  O
was  O
a  O
refreshing  O
starter  O
for  O
a  O
beautiful  O
meal  O
waiting  O
for  O
us  O
.  O

Pig  O
's  O
Ear  O
with  O

4.2/5  O

The  O
Pig  O
's  O
Ear  O
with  O
peanut  O
dressing  O
(  O
$  O
8  O
)  O
was  O
my  O
favourite  O
starters  O
among  O
the  O
three  O
.  O

The  O
delectable  O
dressing  O
accompanied  O
with  O
the  O
crutchy  O
texture  O
was  O
really  O
enjoyable  O
.  O

Tebichi  O
,  O
Simmered  O
Pork  O
Knuckle  O
4/5  O

As  O
I  O
mentioned  O
we  O
were  O
famished  O
,  O
so  O
all  O
of  O
us  O
went  O
for  O
the  O
set  O
meal  O
which  O
came  O
with  O
our  O
individual  O
mains  O
plus  O
plain  O
rice  O
,  O
soup  O
,  O
vinegared  O
vege  O
dish  O
,  O
fried  O
meat  O
miso  O
andpeanut  O
beancurd  O
.  O

I  O
had  O
the  O
Tebichi  O
,  O
Simmered  O
Pork  O
Knuckle  O
set  O
meal  O
(  O
$  O
17++  O
)  O
which  O
was  O
packed  O
with  O
collagen  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
rather  O
``  O
gelat  O
''  O
(  O
Malay  O
expression  O
to  O
denote  O
extreme  O
weariness  O
and  O
irritation  O
at  O
repetition  O
)  O
if  O
you  O
are  O
just  O
having  O
it  O
alone  O
without  O
other  O
sides  O
.  O

Rafute  O

Set  O
Meal  O

Charlene  O
and  O
my  O
girlfriend  O
had  O
the  O
Rafute  O
,  O
Simmer  O
Pork  O
Belly  O
set  O
meal  O
(  O
$  O
17++  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
melted  O
in  O
the  O
mouth  O
pork  O
belly  O
was  O
simply  O
``  O
oishii  O
''  O
.  O

As  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
,  O
the  O
dish  O
has  O
the  O
influence  O
of  O
Chinese  O
cuisine  O
which  O
is  O
similar  O
to  O
our  O
braised  O
pork  O
belly  O
.  O

The  O
French  O
Onion  O
Soup  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
was  O
decent  O
but  O
not  O
awesome  O
.  O

I  O
could  O
n't  O
really  O
taste  O
the  O
sweetness  O
of  O
the  O

The  O

was  O
pretty  O
good  O
.  O

The  O
duck  O
meat  O
was  O
so  O
moist  O
and  O
tender  O
that  O
it  O
slipped  O
off  O
with  O
bone  O
with  O
ease  O
.  O

The  O
sweetness  O
of  O
the  O
sauce  O
cutting  O
through  O
the  O
meat  O
was  O
also  O
interesting  O
and  O
delightful  O

A  O
hot  O
favourite  O
at  O

in  O

,  O
the  O
Jumbo  O

me  O
may  O
not  O
be  O
the  O
best  O
,  O
the  O
jumbo  O
prawn  O
's  O
texture  O
was  O
firmer  O
and  O
tougher  O
than  O

which  O
I  O
do  O

really  O
enjoy  O

Before  O
I  O
go  O
into  O
the  O

item  O
at  O
Wooloomooloo  O
,  O
some  O
facts  O
from  O
the  O
butcher  O
's  O
block  O
.  O

Each  O
cut  O
of  O
steak  O
at  O
Wooloomooloo  O
is  O
handpicked  O
,  O
cut  O
in-house  O
and  O
prepared  O
by  O
eperienced  O
hands  O
.  O

Each  O
slab  O
is  O
flavoured  O
with  O
seasoned  O
sea  O
salt  O
and  O
broiled  O
at  O
980  O
degrees  O
Celsius  O
inside  O
the  O
gleaming  O
Southbend  O
broilers  O
from  O
USA  O
to  O
attain  O
the  O
ideal  O
medium-rare  O
doneness  O
.  O

The  O
150-day  O
grain-fed  O
,  O
wet-aged  O
Ribeye  O
Steak  O
(  O
12-ounce  O
$  O
74  O
)  O
definitely  O
was  O
the  O
brightest  O
star  O
of  O
the  O
night  O
.  O

I  O
remembered  O
exchanging  O
glance  O
with  O
Jacob  O
(  O
www.cooksnapeatlove.com  O
)  O
who  O
like  O
me  O
has  O
tried  O
the  O
Ribeye  O
at  O
Ruth  O
's  O
Chris  O
Steak  O
House  O
,  O
the  O
ribeye  O
steak  O
brought  O
a  O
smile  O
to  O
our  O
face  O
.  O

The  O
Ribeye  O
Steak  O
at  O
Wooloomooloo  O
was  O
extremely  O
flavourful  O
and  O
succulent  O
.  O

Australian  O
Black  O
Angus  O
Tomahawk  O
3.5/5  O

The  O
70-day  O
grained-fed  O
,  O
wet-aged  O
,  O
young  O
Black  O
Angus  O
cut  O
is  O
thus  O
named  O
for  O
its  O
resemblance  O
to  O
a  O
Native  O
Amercian  O
Indian  O
battle  O
axe  O
or  O
tomahawk  O
.  O

I  O
felt  O
that  O
it  O
looked  O
more  O
like  O
a  O
baseball  O
bat  O
.  O

That  O
is  O
how  O
gigantic  O
the  O
Black  O
Angus  O
Tomahawk  O
(  O
$  O
125  O
)  O
is  O
.  O

The  O
massive  O
whole  O
rib  O
steak  O
weights  O
a  O
good  O
1.1kg  O
to  O
1.3kg  O
with  O
bone  O
in  O
and  O
is  O
served  O
medium  O
rare  O
after  O
20  O
minutes  O
in  O
the  O
broiler  O
.  O

I  O
can  O
understand  O
the  O
difficulty  O
in  O
cooking  O
such  O
a  O
big  O
pieces  O
of  O
cut  O
.  O

The  O
doneness  O
was  O
rather  O
inconsistent  O
.  O

Since  O
the  O
huge  O
portion  O
is  O
meant  O
to  O
be  O
shared  O
,  O
maybe  O
it  O
will  O
satisfy  O
the  O
different  O
preference  O
of  O
doneness  O
for  O
the  O
table  O
.  O

The  O
meat  O
was  O
weak  O
in  O
flavour  O
and  O
texture  O
was  O
rather  O
chewy  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
prefer  O
the  O
ribeye  O
more  O
than  O
the  O
tomahawk  O
.  O

the  O
meal  O
,  O
all  O

offer  O
a  O
line-up  O
of  O
side  O
dishes  O
so  O
does  O
Wooloomooloo  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
session  O
,  O
I  O
got  O
to  O
tried  O
3  O
of  O
their  O
signature  O
sides  O

They  O
were  O

)  O
and  O

(  O

.  O

My  O
favourite  O
was  O
the  O
Sauteed  O
Kiplfer  O
Potatoes  O
,  O
nicely  O
seasoned  O
,  O
flavourful  O
and  O
tasty  O
.  O

Wooloomooloo  O

on  O

There  O
was  O

much  O
room  O
left  O
to  O
indulge  O
in  O
all  O
the  O
11  O
variety  O
of  O
desserts  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
I  O
still  O
got  O
my  O
sweet  O
fix  O
in  O
the  O
Pavlova  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
with  O
Chantilly  O
Cream  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
my  O
first  O
time  O
having  O
the  O

dessert  O
.  O

Love  O
the  O

The  O
Bread  O
and  O
Butter  O
Pudding  O
(  O

came  O
with  O
freshly  O
baked  O

,  O
pastry  O
cream  O
,  O
homemade  O
praline  O
and  O
a  O

.  O

A  O
lovely  O
dessert  O
to  O
end  O
the  O
night  O
with  O
a  O
sweet  O
note  O
.  O

Wooloomooloo  O
Steakhouse  O
has  O
an  O
inviting  O
,  O
relax  O
and  O
casual  O
ambience  O
although  O
it  O
is  O
labelled  O
as  O
a  O
premium  O
steakhouses  O
.  O

Besides  O
the  O
steak  O
which  O
I  O
understand  O
some  O
people  O
does  O
not  O
take  O
beef  O
,  O
the  O
restaurant  O
also  O
offers  O
other  O
scrumptious  O
selection  O
including  O
specialities  O
such  O
as  O
Pan-Seared  O
Barramundi  O
Fillet  O
(  O

)  O
,  O
Grilled  O

and  O
Australian  O

Cutlets  O
(  O

.  O

As  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
,  O
there  O
is  O
something  O
for  O
everyone  O
and  O
the  O
restaurant  O
is  O
not  O
just  O
about  O
steak  O

presents  O
signature  O
creations  O
from  O
a  O
menu  O
highlighting  O
modern  O
cuisine  O
with  O

pays  O
homeage  O
to  O
traditional  O
values  O
in  O
relaxed  O
,  O
modern  O
and  O
stylish  O
surroundings  O
.  O

From  O
the  O
previous  O
Singapore  O
Restaurant  O
Week  O
,  O
we  O
understand  O
that  O
seats  O
at  O
these  O
fine  O
dining  O
and  O
middle-market  O
restaurants  O
are  O
greatly  O
sought  O
after  O
.  O

I  O
understand  O
from  O
the  O
organisers  O
that  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
people  O
made  O
numerous  O
bookings  O
and  O
no  O
show  O
rate  O
is  O
the  O
highest  O
in  O
Singapore  O
.  O

It  O
caused  O
inconvenience  O
to  O
the  O
restaurants  O
and  O
by  O
doing  O
that  O
you  O
may  O
unintentionally  O
took  O
up  O
the  O
seats  O
of  O
your  O
friend  O
.  O

I  O
think  O
it  O
is  O
the  O
courtesy  O
of  O
us  O
to  O
call  O
up  O
the  O
restaurant  O
if  O
we  O
ca  O
n't  O
make  O
it  O
.  O

In  O
doing  O
so  O
,  O
the  O
restaurant  O
can  O
free  O
up  O
the  O
seats  O
for  O
others  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
upcoming  O
event  O
,  O
I  O
understand  O
DiningCity.com  O
will  O
implement  O
some  O
new  O
measures  O
to  O
lower  O
the  O
no  O
show  O
rate  O
.  O

On  O
top  O
of  O
that  O
,  O
they  O
will  O
also  O
update  O
on  O
their  O
twitter  O
account  O
(  O
www.twitter.com/DiningCitySG  O
)  O
whenever  O
seats  O
are  O
freed  O

Thus  O
Noodlestar  O

is  O
born  O
.  O

Noodlestar  O
restaurant  O
is  O
not  O
just  O
about  O
noodles  O
.  O

In  O

While  O

off  O

Crispy  O
Fried  O
Silver  O
Fish  O
with  O
Pepper  O
&  O
Salt  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
.  O

The  O
lightly  O
battered  O
crispiness  O
and  O
the  O
fatty  O
silver  O
fish  O
meat  O
was  O
an  O
enjoyable  O
starter  O
.  O

I  O
could  O
not  O
resist  O
going  O
back  O
for  O
more  O
.  O

Best  O
to  O
go  O
with  O
a  O

Sliced  O
Pork  O
with  O
Garlic  O

Next  O
up  O
was  O
the  O
Sliced  O
Pork  O
with  O
Garlic  O
Sauce  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
.  O

Hidden  O
underneath  O
the  O

sliceswas  O
a  O
mountain  O
of  O
refreshing  O
shredded  O
cucumber  O
.  O

If  O
the  O
sliced  O
pork  O
was  O
eaten  O
alone  O
,  O
thesweetness  O
from  O
the  O
garlic  O
sauce  O
maybe  O
a  O
bit  O
overpowering  O
.  O

However  O
if  O
eaten  O
together  O
with  O
the  O
shredded  O
cucumber  O
,  O
it  O
gave  O
the  O
disharefreshing  O
balance  O

Cordyceps  O

The  O
nourishing  O
Cordyceps  O
Flower  O
Herbal  O
Soup  O
(  O
$  O
8.80  O
)  O
is  O
the  O
Chef  O
's  O
new  O
creation  O
.  O

The  O
soup  O
was  O
cooked  O
with  O
black  O
chicken  O
and  O
a  O
combination  O
of  O

that  O

on  O
the  O

.  O

This  O
souphas  O
a  O
stronger  O

.  O

Steamed  O
Juicy  O
Meat  O
Dumpling  O
4.5/5  O

More  O
does  O
not  O
always  O
mean  O
better  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
tried  O
Xiao  O
Long  O
Bao  O
that  O
was  O
overly  O
chunky  O
with  O
their  O
fillings  O
thus  O
losing  O
that  O
balance  O
in  O
texture  O
and  O
flavours  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
pleasantly  O
surprised  O
that  O
the  O
Steamed  O
Juicy  O
Meat  O
Dumpling  O
(  O
$  O
4.80  O
)  O
or  O
Xiao  O
Long  O
Bao  O
at  O
Noodlestar  O
was  O
rather  O
delicate  O
in  O
execution  O
.  O

The  O
subtle  O
Xiao  O
Long  O
Baowas  O
probably  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
bestI  O

Dumpling  O
with  O
Hot  O
and  O
Sour  O
Sauce  O
3.5/5  O

The  O
marriage  O
of  O
the  O
Dumpling  O
with  O
Hot  O
&  O
Sour  O
sauce  O
(  O
$  O
4.80  O
)  O
did  O
not  O
really  O
work  O
out  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

Do  O
n't  O
get  O
me  O
wrong  O
,  O
individually  O
the  O
dumpling  O
and  O
sauce  O
was  O
good  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
greatly  O
have  O
them  O
separately  O
but  O
they  O
are  O
just  O
not  O
compatible  O
with  O
each  O
other  O
.  O

Four  O
Season  O
Happiness  O
Dumpling  O
3.8/5  O

This  O
is  O
such  O
a  O
happy  O
dish  O
visually  O
with  O
its  O
vibrant  O
colours  O
.  O

The  O
Four  O
Season  O
Happiness  O
Dumpling  O
(  O
$  O
4.80  O
)  O
comes  O
in  O
4  O
colourful  O
fillings  O
.  O

They  O
were  O
broccoli  O
(  O
green  O
)  O
,  O
egg  O
yolk  O
(  O
yellow  O
)  O
,  O
black  O
fungus  O
(  O
black  O
)  O
and  O
ham  O
(  O
pink  O
)  O
.  O

Although  O
the  O
flavours  O
were  O
rather  O
mild  O
what  O
stood  O
out  O
was  O
the  O
dumpling  O
skin  O
.  O

After  O
trying  O
3  O
of  O
their  O
dumpling  O
dishes  O
,  O
the  O
soft  O
and  O
thin  O
texture  O
of  O
the  O
dumpling  O
skin  O
definitely  O
won  O
my  O
heart  O
.  O

Pan  O

Pork  O
Dumpling  O

that  O
the  O

one  O
of  O
their  O
popular  O
dishes  O
on  O
the  O

I  O
can  O
understand  O
why  O
since  O
I  O
have  O
already  O
sang  O
praises  O
of  O
their  O
dumplings  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
another  O
dish  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
which  O
I  O
would  O
order  O
again  O
.  O

The  O
La  O

It  O
was  O
full  O

Even  O
the  O

Chef  O
's  O
Tip  O
-  O
The  O
cake  O
has  O
to  O
be  O
shiny  O
when  O
you  O
remove  O
it  O
from  O
the  O
pan  O
.  O

This  O
means  O
that  O
the  O
inside  O
is  O
still  O
soft  O
.  O

-  O
You  O
may  O
prepare  O
the  O
chocolate  O
cake  O
a  O
day  O
in  O
advance  O
and  O
heat  O
it  O
up  O
before  O
serving  O
.  O

-  O
For  O
this  O
cake  O
,  O
the  O
dark  O
chocolate  O
used  O
has  O
to  O
be  O
at  O
70  O
%  O
so  O
that  O
it  O
pairs  O
well  O
with  O
the  O
sweetness  O
of  O
the  O
sorbet  O
and  O
sugar  O

E.Clat  O
which  O
means  O
brilliancy  O

is  O
a  O
concept  O
by  O
a  O
groupof  O
property  O
agents  O
to  O
offer  O
fine  O
dining  O
for  O
the  O
masses  O
.  O

However  O
the  O
owner  O
also  O
mentioned  O
that  O
they  O
wanted  O
to  O
serve  O
comfort  O
and  O
fun  O
food  O
.  O

That  O
got  O
me  O
confused  O
.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
has  O
a  O
seating  O
capacity  O
for  O
110  O
pax  O
.  O

It  O
also  O
has  O
a  O
cooking  O

they  O
plan  O
tohold  O
cooking  O

in  O

Tomato  O
Bruschetta2/5  O

The  O
Tomato  O
Bruschetta  O
(  O
$  O
6.90  O
for  O
4pc  O
)  O
looked  O
rather  O
pretty  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
let  O
down  O
by  O
the  O
stale  O
home  O
made  O
foccacia  O
.  O

E.Clat  O
Cheesy  O
Onion  O
Fries  O
2.5/5  O

I  O
wastold  O
that  O
the  O
Cheesy  O
Onion  O
Fries  O
(  O
$  O
9.90  O
)  O
was  O
a  O
creation  O
by  O
the  O
boss  O
himself  O
.  O

The  O
cheeses  O
used  O
were  O
a  O
combination  O
of  O
mozzarella  O
and  O
cheddar  O
.  O

Iwas  O
getting  O
concerned  O
.  O

I  O
could  O
n't  O
relate  O
fine  O
dining  O
,  O
comfort  O
and  O
fun  O
food  O
in  O
this  O
dish  O
.  O

The  O
only  O
word  O
flashing  O
across  O
my  O
mind  O
was  O
messy  O
.  O

Beer  O
Battered  O
Fish  O
and  O
Chips  O
4/5  O

The  O
Beer  O
Battered  O
Fish  O
and  O
Chips  O
(  O
$  O
16.90  O
)  O
was  O
probably  O
the  O
best  O
among  O
all  O
the  O
dishes  O
for  O
the  O
tasting  O
session  O
.  O

It  O
had  O
a  O
nice  O
thin  O
and  O
crisp  O
batter  O
around  O
the  O
succulent  O
and  O
fish  O
.  O

It  O
also  O
comes  O
with  O
breaded  O
Fish  O
and  O
Chips  O
if  O
you  O
do  O
not  O
like  O
beer  O

Seafood  O
Baked  O
Rice  O
2.5/5  O

The  O
rice  O
for  O
the  O
Seafood  O
Baked  O
Rice  O
(  O
$  O
10.90  O
)  O
in  O
tomato  O
sauce  O
was  O
rather  O
bland  O
.  O

The  O
tangy  O
tomato  O
flavour  O
was  O
not  O
distinct  O
or  O
rather  O
missing  O
from  O
the  O
dish  O
.  O

It  O
made  O
me  O
wonder  O
if  O
the  O
kitchen  O
has  O
ran  O
out  O
of  O
cheese  O
,  O
cause  O
I  O
would  O
love  O
to  O
see  O
more  O
in  O
my  O
baked  O
rice  O
.  O

Black  O
Pepper  O
Beef  O
Pasta  O
3/5  O

The  O
Black  O
Pepper  O
Beef  O
Pasta  O
(  O
$  O
12  O
)  O
supposed  O
to  O
be  O
E.Clat  O
most  O
popular  O
dish  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
it  O
was  O
rather  O
pedestrian  O
.  O

The  O
beef  O
was  O
well  O
marinated  O
and  O
tender  O
but  O
black  O
pepper  O
sauce  O
needs  O
more  O
kick  O
to  O
it  O
.  O

Egg  O
Benedict  O
3/5  O

My  O
Egg  O
Benedict  O
(  O
$  O
10.90  O
)  O
was  O
beautifully  O
cooked  O
with  O
the  O
yolk  O
of  O
the  O
poached  O
egg  O
oozing  O
out  O
when  O
cut  O
.  O

However  O
the  O
hollandaise  O
sauce  O
was  O
a  O
tad  O
watered  O
down  O
and  O
I  O
disliked  O
the  O
stale  O
home  O
made  O
foccacia  O
.  O

Smoked  O
Duck  O
Pizza  O
3.8/5  O

The  O
Smoked  O
Duck  O
Pizza  O
(  O
$  O
18.90  O
)  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
thin  O
crisp  O
crust  O
.  O

The  O
truffle  O
mayonnaise  O
was  O
interesting  O
butthe  O
way  O
it  O
was  O
on  O
the  O
pizza  O
,  O
I  O
had  O
trouble  O
figuring  O
how  O
best  O
to  O
consume  O
it  O
toget  O
an  O
even  O
spread  O
of  O
the  O
truffle  O

the  O

composing  O
the  O
post  O
,  O
I  O
realized  O
the  O
grilled  O
fish  O
was  O
sliced  O
into  O
strips  O
.  O

Visually  O
I  O
think  O
people  O
would  O
expect  O
a  O
whole  O
piece  O
of  O
fish  O
fillet  O
so  O
they  O
do  O
n't  O
feel  O
short  O
changed  O
.  O

Baked  O
Macaroni  O
3/5  O

The  O
Baked  O
Macaroni  O
(  O
$  O
9.50  O
)  O
unfortunately  O
was  O
a  O
let  O
down  O
.  O

Though  O
the  O
macaroni  O
was  O
nicely  O
cooked  O
,  O
they  O
were  O
kind  O
of  O
bland  O
.  O

Fresh  O
Sage  O
Sausage  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
Freash  O
Sausage  O
(  O
$  O
13.80  O
)  O
came  O
a  O
bit  O
on  O
the  O
salty  O
side  O
but  O
if  O
paired  O
with  O
the  O
mashed  O
potatoes  O
and  O
sauce  O
,  O
it  O
actually  O
had  O
a  O
good  O
balanced  O
of  O
flavours  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
one  O
of  O
my  O
favourite  O
dish  O
at  O
Canadian  O
Pizza  O
Dine-In  O
Cafe  O
.  O

Crazy  O
Canadian  O
Stacker  O
4/5  O

The  O
Crazy  O
Canadian  O
Stacker  O
(  O
$  O
14.90  O
)  O
came  O
with  O
double  O
patties  O
,  O
grilled  O
bacon  O
,  O
lettuce  O
,  O
tomato  O
,  O
onion  O
rings  O
,  O
cheese  O
and  O
fries  O
.  O

The  O
huge  O
and  O
juicy  O
burger  O
was  O
packed  O
with  O
flavours  O
and  O
it  O
was  O
not  O
going  O
to  O
be  O
easy  O
for  O
one  O
with  O
a  O
small  O
appetite  O
.  O

Peri  O
Peri  O
Chicken  O
3.8/5  O

I  O
was  O
worry  O
that  O
the  O
Peri  O
Peri  O
Chicken  O
(  O
$  O
16  O
)  O
may  O
be  O
too  O
hot  O
for  O
my  O
taste  O
buds  O
but  O
they  O
were  O
quite  O
mild  O
and  O
easily  O
for  O
the  O
palate  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O
has  O
a  O
nice  O
crisp  O
on  O
the  O
outside  O
while  O
tender  O
inside  O
.  O

Served  O
with  O
fries  O
and  O
salad  O
.  O

Steak  O
Sandwich  O
4/5  O

Stacked  O
with  O
grilled  O
beef  O
,  O
onion  O
rings  O
,  O
lettuce  O
,  O
tomatoes  O
and  O
brown  O
sauce  O
,  O
the  O
Steak  O
Sandwich  O
(  O
$  O
13.90  O
)  O
was  O
worth  O
the  O
penny  O
.  O

The  O
perfectly  O
grilled  O
beef  O
impressed  O
me  O
and  O
well  O
paired  O
with  O
the  O
special  O
brown  O
sauce  O
.  O

Brownie  O

also  O
offers  O
some  O
classic  O
desserts  O
for  O
the  O
sweet  O
tooth  O
.  O

We  O
tried  O
the  O
Brownie  O
,  O
Bread  O
Pudding  O
and  O
Apple  O
Crumble  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
I  O
did  O
n't  O
get  O
to  O
note  O
down  O
the  O
price  O
.  O

The  O
dessert  O
was  O
nothing  O
to  O
shout  O
for  O
but  O
decently  O
good  O
.  O

In  O
a  O
small  O
way  O
I  O
am  O
quite  O
excited  O
about  O
Canadian  O
Pizza  O
Dine-In  O

.  O

When  O
our  O
teas  O
were  O
served  O
,  O
we  O
were  O
all  O
like  O
wondering  O
how  O
to  O
read  O
with  O
the  O
tea  O
pot  O
submerged  O
inside  O
a  O
glass  O
.  O

The  O

I  O
remembered  O
that  O
the  O

I  O

beautifully  O

with  O
the  O
rose  O
wine  O
sauce  O
.  O

The  O
herb  O

a  O

touch  O
to  O
the  O

potatoes  O
.  O

Understand  O
from  O
her  O
the  O

was  O
a  O
tad  O
salty  O

compliment  O
the  O

very  O
well  O
.  O

However  O

felt  O
that  O

be  O
more  O
generous  O
with  O
the  O
sauce  O

Back  O
in  O
July  O
2012  O
when  O
I  O
attended  O
the  O
Heineken  O
Star  O
Serve  O
event  O
at  O
The  O
Exchange  O
,  O
the  O
organiser  O
was  O
very  O
kind  O
to  O
order  O
us  O
some  O
finger  O
food  O
to  O
go  O
with  O
the  O
beer  O
.  O

Crispy  O
White  O
Bait  O
4/5  O

This  O
is  O
my  O
first  O
time  O
seeing  O
and  O
havingsuch  O
big  O
Crispy  O
White  O
Bait  O
(  O
$  O
13  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
fried  O
white  O
bait  O
was  O
big  O
and  O
fat  O
so  O
it  O
was  O
quite  O
enjoyable  O
biting  O
into  O
the  O
meaty  O
texture  O
.  O

The  O
saltiness  O
of  O
the  O
white  O
bait  O
is  O
the  O
perfect  O
reason  O
for  O
me  O
to  O
wash  O
it  O
down  O
with  O
more  O
beer  O
.  O

Truffle  O
and  O
Parmesan  O
Fries  O
4/5  O

I  O
like  O
how  O
the  O
Truffle  O
&  O
Parmesan  O
Fries  O
(  O
$  O
10  O
)  O
was  O
served  O
in  O
a  O
rustic  O
bucket  O
.  O

The  O
combo  O
of  O
flavours  O
from  O
the  O
truffle  O
oil  O
and  O
parmesan  O
simply  O
made  O
the  O
fries  O
tasted  O
a  O
notch  O
better  O
.  O

Skewers  O
and  O
Sharing  O
Platters  O
4/5  O

I  O
could  O
n't  O
really  O
make  O
out  O
what  O
the  O
organiser  O
had  O
ordered  O
but  O
it  O
seems  O
to  O
be  O
that  O
they  O
have  O
ordered  O
the  O
Chicken  O
and  O
Lamb  O
Skewers  O
,  O
Sharing  O
Platter  O
and  O
other  O
nibbles  O
sides  O
.  O

Simply  O
loved  O
and  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
platter  O
of  O
nibbles  O
especially  O
with  O
a  O
glass  O
of  O
ice  O
cold  O
Heineken  O
beer  O
.  O

Hangar  O
Steak  O
4.5/5  O

You  O
seldom  O
get  O
to  O
see  O
restaurants  O
having  O
Hangar  O
Steak  O
on  O
their  O
menu  O
.  O

Hangar  O
steak  O
is  O
a  O
cutthat  O
is  O
prized  O
for  O
its  O
flavour  O
and  O
weights  O
about  O
450g  O
to  O
675g  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
usually  O
served  O
medium  O
or  O
medium  O
rare  O
or  O
it  O
will  O
be  O
too  O
tough  O
for  O
consumption.The  O
200g  O
Hangar  O
Steak  O
(  O
$  O
40  O
)  O
I  O
had  O
was  O
very  O
bloody  O
but  O
extremely  O
flavourful  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
do  O
n't  O
like  O
your  O
steak  O
too  O
rare  O
,  O
this  O
is  O
not  O
for  O
you  O

Over  O
theNational  O
Day  O
long  O
weekend  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
given  O
2  O
Tefal  O
Intensium  O
pans  O
to  O
play  O
with..oh  O
I  O
meant  O
cooked  O
with  O
.  O

Since  O
my  O
family  O
will  O
be  O
glued  O
in  O
front  O
of  O
the  O
TV  O
to  O
watch  O
the  O
National  O
Day  O
parade  O
,  O
I  O
decided  O
to  O
make  O
some  O
pop  O
corns  O
for  O
the  O
family  O
to  O
snack  O
while  O
watching  O
the  O
parade  O
.  O

The  O
Tefal  O
Intensium  O
Saute-pan  O
is  O
perfect  O
for  O
making  O
the  O
pop  O
corns  O
.  O

With  O
its  O
transparent  O
glass  O
lid  O
,  O
I  O
can  O
easily  O
judge  O
the  O
cooking  O
temperature  O
for  O
the  O
kernel  O
.  O

It  O
also  O
helps  O
to  O
contain  O
the  O
pop  O
corns  O
inside  O
the  O
pan  O
and  O
not  O
popping  O
all  O
over  O
the  O
kitchen  O
's  O
stove  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
quite  O
an  O
enjoyment  O
seeing  O
the  O
kernels  O
popping  O
and  O
dancing  O
inside  O
the  O
pan  O
.  O

With  O
the  O
Tefal  O
Intensium  O
Saute-pan  O
,  O
I  O
can  O
now  O
make  O
pop  O
corns  O
at  O
home  O
with  O
ease  O
.  O

I  O
should  O
try  O
to  O
make  O
more  O
flavours  O
of  O
pop  O
cornsnext  O
time  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
took  O
the  O
opportunity  O
to  O
cook  O
a  O
simple  O
dinner  O
for  O
my  O
family  O
,  O
giving  O
my  O
mum  O
a  O
well  O
desired  O
break  O
.  O

The  O
Thermo-spot  O
pad  O
of  O
the  O
Tefal  O
Intensium  O
pan  O
is  O
pretty  O
cool  O
.  O

I  O
usually  O
will  O
test  O
whether  O
the  O
pan  O
is  O
hot  O
enough  O
for  O
cooking  O
by  O
sprinkling  O
some  O
water  O
droplets  O
.  O

Now  O
with  O
the  O
Thermo-spot  O
,  O
once  O
the  O
pan  O
reached  O
the  O
optimal  O
temperature  O
of  O
180  O
Degree  O
Celsius  O
for  O
cooking  O
,  O
the  O
thermo-spot  O
will  O
become  O
solid  O
red  O
.  O

Check  O
out  O
how  O
evenly  O
and  O
beautifullythe  O
Fermented  O
Beancurd  O
Chicken  O
Wings  O
turned  O
out  O
.  O

I  O
followed  O
the  O
recipes  O
from  O
WokkingMum  O
.  O

The  O
anti-warping  O
base  O
of  O
the  O
Tefal  O
Intensium  O
pan  O
ensures  O
homogeneous  O
heat  O
diffusion  O
for  O
optimum  O
cooking  O
,  O
lowering  O
or  O
even  O
no  O
more  O
risk  O
of  O
overheating  O
and  O
burning  O
.  O

The  O
other  O
dish  O
I  O
cooked  O
for  O
my  O
family  O
was  O
the  O
Vermicelli  O
Omelette  O
.  O

Cooking  O
an  O
egg  O
can  O
be  O
quite  O
tricky  O
.  O

If  O
the  O
pan  O
is  O
not  O
hot  O
enough  O
,  O
the  O
egg  O
will  O
stick  O
to  O
the  O
pan  O
.  O

If  O
it  O
is  O
too  O
hot  O
,  O
it  O
will  O
get  O
burnt  O
easily  O
.  O

With  O
the  O
Tefal  O
Intensium  O
pan  O
and  O
its  O
non  O
stick  O
coating  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
quite  O
surprise  O
that  O
I  O
managed  O
to  O
fry  O
a  O
beautiful  O
vermicelli  O
omelette  O
rather  O
effortless  O
.  O

Do  O
n't  O
you  O
hate  O
it  O
after  O
all  O
the  O
cooking  O
you  O
still  O
need  O
to  O
do  O
the  O
washing  O
up  O
.  O

That  O
is  O
exactly  O
why  O
I  O
love  O
using  O
non  O
stick  O
pan  O
as  O
it  O
can  O
be  O
washed  O
easily  O
.  O

I  O
just  O
need  O
to  O
soak  O
it  O
with  O
warm  O
soapy  O
water  O
,  O
used  O
an  O
non  O
abrasive  O
washing  O
sponge  O
or  O
dishcloth  O
to  O
clean  O
the  O
surface  O
and  O
rinse  O
it  O
with  O
water  O
.  O

out  O

Seafood  O
Platter  O
4/5  O

We  O
started  O
off  O
with  O
the  O
Seafood  O
Platter  O
(  O
$  O
28++  O
)  O
.  O

It  O
came  O
with  O
an  O
assortment  O
of  O
grilled  O
prawns  O
,  O
calamari  O
rings  O
,  O
battered  O
sea  O
bass  O
fillet  O
,  O
soft  O
shell  O
crab  O
served  O
on  O
a  O
bed  O
of  O
french  O
fries  O
with  O
tartar  O
sauce  O
.  O

Fresh  O
fried  O
seafood  O
with  O
tartar  O
sauce  O
would  O
never  O
go  O
wrong  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
,  O
the  O
grilled  O
prawns  O
will  O
a  O
little  O
under  O
cooked  O
.  O

Crispy  O
Sea  O
Bass  O
4/5  O

The  O
Crispy  O
Sea  O
Bass  O
(  O
$  O
26++  O
)  O
was  O
served  O
with  O
pesto  O
sauce  O
,  O
mashed  O
potatoes  O
and  O
vegetables  O
.  O

The  O
pan  O
fried  O
sea  O
bass  O
was  O
beautifully  O
executed  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
crisp  O
on  O
the  O
skin  O
and  O
moist  O
inside  O
.  O

However  O
,  O
I  O
did  O
not  O
enjoy  O
the  O
pesto  O
sauce  O
pairing  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
preferthe  O
sauce  O
to  O
bemore  O
zesty  O
though  O
.  O

Chilli  O
Crab  O
Spaghetti  O
4/5  O

I  O
was  O
actually  O
looking  O
forward  O
to  O
the  O
Chilli  O
Crab  O
Spaghetti  O
(  O
$  O
26++  O
)  O
.  O

Having  O
tried  O
the  O
Chilli  O
Crab  O
sauce  O
at  O
Hard  O
Rock  O
Cafe  O
,  O
I  O
knew  O
it  O
was  O
good  O
.  O

The  O
sweetness  O
of  O
the  O
fresh  O
crab  O
meats  O
and  O
the  O
spicy  O
sauce  O
coating  O
the  O
spaghetti  O
was  O
an  O
enjoyment  O
.  O

If  O
I  O
could  O
substitute  O
the  O
2  O
pieces  O
of  O
toasted  O
bread  O
for  O
a  O
crab  O
claw  O
or  O
maybe  O
some  O
fried  O
soft  O
shell  O
crabs  O
,  O
visually  O
it  O
will  O
look  O
more  O
value  O
for  O
money  O
.  O

Crab  O
Fried  O
Rice  O
4.2/5  O

Last  O
but  O
not  O
least  O
,  O
we  O
tried  O
the  O
Crab  O
Fried  O
Rice  O
(  O
$  O
20++  O
)  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
wok  O
fried  O
withsucculent  O
crab  O
meat  O
,  O
prawns  O
and  O
diced  O
portobello  O
mushroom  O
,  O
wrappedin  O
an  O
egg  O
omelette  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
very  O
tasty  O
and  O
fragrant  O
.  O

Probably  O
my  O
favourite  O
out  O
of  O
the  O
4  O
new  O
seafood  O
dishes  O
in  O
terms  O
of  O
taste  O
but  O
not  O
the  O
price  O
.  O

Overall  O
the  O
new  O
seafood  O
menu  O
at  O
Hard  O
Rock  O
Cafe  O
definitely  O
passed  O
the  O
mark  O
but  O
the  O
pricing  O
maybe  O
a  O
bit  O
challenging  O
.  O

A  O
great  O
thanks  O
to  O
Natalie  O
for  O
having  O
us  O
and  O
Andy  O
for  O
coordinating  O
the  O

The  O
clear  O
winner  O
among  O
the  O

was  O
Tiong  O

The  O

The  O
exquisite  O

Noodles  O
Soup  O
(  O

came  O
with  O
a  O
generous  O
serving  O
of  O

Yes  O
meatballs  O
,  O
quite  O
interesting  O
that  O
the  O
stall  O
served  O
meatballs  O
in  O
their  O
prawn  O

Unfortunately  O
the  O
meatballs  O
lacked  O
flavours  O
and  O
textures  O

The  O

also  O
missed  O
out  O

The  O
glutinous  O

was  O
recommeneded  O
by  O

It  O
was  O
rather  O
fragrant  O
but  O
I  O
still  O
think  O
it  O
lacked  O
the  O
aroma  O
from  O

The  O

I  O
was  O

whenever  O

used  O

As  O
you  O
can  O
see  O
from  O
the  O
picture  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
not  O
the  O
real  O
stuff  O

The  O
so  O
called  O
shark  O
fins  O
were  O
actually  O
made  O
from  O
jelly  O
strips  O

It  O
was  O
another  O
fun  O
and  O
successful  O

Many  O
thanks  O

Greatly  O

Daniel  O

for  O

giving  O
me  O
the  O
opportunity  O
to  O

some  O

family  O
.  O


If  O
you  O
have  O
been  O
following  O
my  O
blog  O
,  O
you  O
would  O
probably  O
know  O
that  O
I  O
have  O
been  O
down  O
at  O
Tiong  O
Bahru  O
market  O
&  O
food  O
centre  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
stalls  O
as  O
I  O
was  O
planning  O
for  O
a  O
hawker  O
trail  O
at  O
Tiong  O
Bahru  O
market  O
&  O
food  O
centre  O
.  O

In  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
trips  O
,  O
I  O
decided  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O
cafe  O
culture  O
that  O
is  O
booming  O
in  O
the  O
area  O
.  O

Initially  O
I  O
wanted  O
to  O
go  O
to  O
either  O
Forty  O
Hands  O
or  O
Tiong  O
Bahru  O
Bakery  O
but  O
both  O
places  O
were  O
full  O
.  O

Disappointment  O
was  O
short  O
lived  O
when  O
I  O
turned  O
the  O
corner  O
onto  O
Tiong  O
Road  O
and  O
found  O
Drips  O
Bakery  O
Cafe  O
.  O

Blackberry  O
Almond  O
Tart  O
4/5  O

Many  O
reviews  O
have  O
mentioned  O
about  O
the  O
tarts  O
at  O
Drips  O
Bakery  O
Cafe  O
.  O

Since  O
my  O
girlfriend  O
and  O
Iwere  O
still  O
quite  O
full  O
from  O
lunch  O
,  O
we  O
ordered  O
a  O
slice  O
of  O
Blackberry  O
Almond  O
Tart  O
(  O
$  O
7.50  O
)  O
to  O
share  O
.  O

The  O
crumbly  O
pastry  O
base  O
was  O
really  O
enjoyable  O
.  O

The  O
fruity  O
topping  O
,  O
almond  O
cream  O
and  O
pastry  O
base  O
were  O
layered  O
in  O
a  O
nice  O
textural  O
balanced  O
proportion  O
.  O

What  O
we  O
did  O
not  O
enjoy  O
is  O
the  O
seedy  O
bites  O
we  O
can  O
find  O
in  O
the  O
blackberry  O
toppings  O
.  O

Mocha  O
4/5  O

With  O
that  O
many  O
cafes  O
setting  O
up  O
at  O
Tiong  O
Bahru  O
area  O
,  O
I  O
thought  O
the  O
name  O
``  O
Little  O
Melbourne  O
''  O
is  O
rather  O
appropriate  O
for  O
the  O
buzz  O
in  O
the  O
area  O
.  O

I  O
love  O
my  O
coffee  O
and  O
drink  O
like  O
3-4  O
cups  O
a  O
day  O
.  O

However  O
I  O
admit  O
I  O
do  O
not  O
know  O
how  O
to  O
differentiate  O
coffee  O
and  O
I  O
look  O
forward  O
to  O
attending  O
coffee  O
workshop  O
to  O
widen  O
by  O
knowledge  O
in  O
coffee  O
appreciation  O
.  O

Latte  O
4/5  O

Anyway  O
I  O
ordered  O
by  O
usual  O
Cafee  O
Latte  O
(  O
$  O
4.80  O
)  O
while  O
my  O
girlfriend  O
had  O
the  O
Mocha  O
(  O
$  O
5.50  O
)  O
.  O

We  O
felt  O
that  O
the  O
barista  O
made  O
quite  O
a  O
decent  O
cup  O
of  O
coffee  O
.  O

Drips  O
Bakery  O
Cafe  O
is  O
a  O
nice  O
cozy  O
place  O
to  O
laze  O
the  O
afternoon  O
sipping  O
a  O
cup  O
of  O
aromatic  O
coffee  O
and  O
enjoying  O
their  O
popular  O
tarts  O
.  O

All  O
prices  O
are  O
nett  O
too  O

Jacob  O
floated  O
the  O
idea  O
with  O
Maureen  O
,  O
Shiting  O
and  O
me  O
that  O
we  O
should  O
do  O
a  O
monthly  O
dinner  O
thingy  O
todine  O
atrestaurant  O
that  O
we  O
want  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
.  O

After  O
throwing  O
a  O
few  O
suggestions  O
we  O
decided  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
Le  O
Bistrot  O
du  O
Sommelier  O
that  O
has  O
moved  O
from  O
its  O
previous  O
location  O
at  O
Prinsep  O

to  O
their  O
new  O
home  O
at  O
Armenian  O

Braised  O
Pig  O
Trotter  O
4/5  O

Jacob  O
and  O
Shiting  O
both  O
had  O
the  O
Braised  O
Pig  O
Trotter  O
(  O
$  O
36  O
)  O
stuffed  O
with  O
veal  O
sweetbreads  O
served  O
with  O
steamed  O
vegetables  O
and  O
mash  O
potatoes  O
.  O

The  O
portion  O
and  O
presentation  O
was  O
rather  O
intimidating  O
to  O
finish  O
.  O

Not  O
to  O
forget  O
the  O
generous  O
serving  O
of  O
stuffed  O
veal  O
sweetbreads  O
unless  O
you  O
have  O
an  O
enormous  O
and  O
adventurous  O
appetite  O
.  O

Beef  O
Short  O
Ribs  O
4.2/5  O

For  O
myself  O
I  O
have  O
the  O
Beef  O
Short  O
Ribs  O
(  O
$  O
38  O
)  O
which  O
was  O
beautifully  O
cooked  O
.  O

The  O
portion  O
was  O
rather  O
huge  O
again  O
consider  O
this  O
is  O
french  O
cuisine  O
.  O

The  O
lovely  O
fork  O
tender  O
meat  O
fell  O
off  O
the  O
bone  O
with  O
easy  O
and  O
made  O
my  O
palate  O
sang  O
to  O
the  O
lovely  O
tunes  O
of  O
flavours  O
.  O

Braised  O
French  O
Chicken  O
Leg  O
4.2/5  O

My  O
girlfriend  O
had  O
the  O
Braised  O
French  O
Chicken  O
Leg  O
(  O
$  O
28  O
)  O
which  O
was  O
interesting  O
served  O
in  O
a  O
claypot  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O
leg  O
was  O
braised  O
in  O
vinegar  O
and  O
tomatoes  O
served  O
with  O
gratin  O
of  O
potatoes  O
at  O
the  O
side  O
.  O

Ignoring  O
the  O
presentation  O
,  O
the  O
tangy  O
broth  O
was  O
rather  O
appertizing  O
and  O
I  O
could  O
n't  O
help  O
going  O
back  O
for  O
more  O
.  O

French  O
Duck  O
Confit  O
4.2/5  O

Jacob  O

partner  O
,  O
Chloe  O
has  O
the  O
French  O
Duck  O
Confit  O
(  O
$  O
28  O
)  O
.  O

I  O
had  O
a  O
piece  O
for  O
taste  O
and  O
I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
texture  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
moist  O
and  O
aromatic  O
.  O

I  O
did  O
n't  O
get  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
beetroot  O
salad  O
but  O
I  O
thought  O
the  O
flavour  O
will  O
be  O
a  O
good  O
balance  O
for  O
the  O
gamey  O
duck  O
.  O

Profiteroles  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
classic  O
Profiteroles  O
(  O

14  O
)  O
simply  O
brought  O
smiles  O
to  O
our  O
faces  O
with  O
each  O
scoop  O
.  O

The  O
warm  O
chocolate  O
sauce  O
and  O
sliced  O
almonds  O

were  O
a  O
welcome  O

to  O
the  O

wonderful  O

The  O
Green  O
Apple  O

(  O

was  O
a  O

.  O

We  O
loved  O
the  O
refreshing  O
sorbet  O
with  O
the  O
green  O
apple  O
bites  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
all  O
of  O
us  O
felt  O
that  O
it  O

too  O
heavy  O
on  O

After  O
hearing  O
about  O
Tom  O
's  O
Palette  O
's  O
Salted  O
Egg  O
Yolk  O
ice  O
cream  O
from  O
Charlene  O
,  O
Jacob  O
,  O
Celes  O
and  O
me  O
made  O
our  O
way  O
down  O
to  O
Tom  O
's  O
Palette  O
Ice  O
Cream  O
parlour  O
at  O
Shaw  O
Leisure  O
Gallery  O
to  O
check  O
it  O
out  O
.  O

The  O
homemade  O
ice  O
cream  O
parlour  O
has  O
been  O
scooping  O
ice  O
cream  O
since  O
September  O
2005  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
quite  O
surprise  O
that  O
they  O
were  O
around  O
even  O
before  O
popular  O
ice  O
cream  O
parlour  O
such  O
as  O

Salted  O
Egg  O
Yolk  O
&  O
Chocolate  O
4/5  O

Celes  O
had  O
the  O
Salted  O
Egg  O
Yolk  O
&  O
Chocolate  O
(  O
$  O
4  O
medium  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
salted  O
egg  O
yolk  O
ice  O
cream  O
definitely  O
did  O
not  O
disappoint  O
us  O
.  O

The  O
tasteand  O
grainy  O
texture  O
of  O
the  O
ice  O
cream  O
resembles  O
those  O
salted  O
egg  O
yolk  O
one  O
can  O
find  O
in  O
mooncakes  O
.  O

We  O
also  O
noticed  O
that  O
the  O
ice  O
cream  O
melted  O
very  O
quickly  O
.  O

After  O
reading  O
up  O
Tom  O
's  O
Palette  O
's  O
website  O
,  O
I  O
realised  O
they  O
do  O
not  O
add  O
stabilisers  O
in  O
their  O
ice  O
cream  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
as  O
natural  O
as  O
it  O
can  O
get  O
for  O
their  O
ice  O
cream  O
.  O

Although  O
stabilisers  O
are  O
extracted  O
from  O
natural  O
sources  O
such  O
as  O
seaweed  O
and  O
algae  O
and  O
added  O
to  O
ice  O
cream  O
to  O
slow  O
down  O
the  O
melting  O
process  O
,  O
the  O
source  O
is  O
natural  O
but  O
the  O
extraction  O
method  O
is  O
man  O
made  O
.  O

Salted  O
Egg  O
Yolk  O
and  O
Quattro  O
4/5  O

For  O
me  O
,  O
I  O
tired  O
the  O
Salted  O
Egg  O
Yolk  O
&  O
Quattro  O
(  O
$  O
4  O
medium  O
)  O
.  O

Quattro  O
was  O
the  O
flavour  O
of  O
the  O
month  O
of  O
July  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
made  O
with  O
sangria  O
,  O
pineapple  O
,  O
raisin  O
and  O
orange  O
.  O

It  O
had  O
a  O
very  O
interesting  O
taste  O
for  O
ice  O
cream  O
and  O
the  O
closest  O
similarity  O
will  O
be  O
Japanese  O
sake  O
,  O
light  O
and  O
refreshing  O

Classic  O
French  O
Onion  O
Soup  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
Classic  O
French  O
Onion  O
Soup  O
(  O
$  O
16.50  O
)  O
was  O
made  O
using  O
chicken  O
and  O
veal  O
broth  O
with  O
caramelized  O
onions  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
accompanied  O
by  O
cheese  O
toasts  O
made  O
from  O
Antoinette  O
's  O
signature  O
24-hour  O
baguette  O
.  O

Traditionally  O
the  O
soup  O
is  O
covered  O
with  O
a  O
layer  O
of  O
cheese  O
and  O
broiled  O
to  O
brown  O
before  O
serving  O
.  O

At  O
Antoinette  O
,  O
this  O
is  O
substituted  O
with  O
a  O
cheese  O
crust  O
cover  O
made  O
from  O
combo  O
of  O
parmesan  O
and  O
gruyere  O
cheese  O
.  O

The  O
richness  O
of  O
the  O
soup  O
had  O
a  O
tad  O
of  O
tangy  O
taste  O
which  O
was  O
quite  O
enjoyablethat  O
paired  O
wellwith  O
the  O
sweetness  O
of  O
the  O
caramelized  O
onions  O
.  O

Tartine  O
de  O
Nicoise  O
4/5  O

The  O
Tartine  O
de  O
Nicoise  O
(  O
$  O
26.00  O
)  O
was  O
crowned  O
by  O
a  O
bed  O
ofbutter  O
lettuce  O
,  O
french  O
beans  O
,  O
tomatoes  O
,  O
olives  O
,  O
a  O
three-minute  O
egg  O
,  O
anchovy  O
and  O
seared  O
tuna  O
on  O
topan  O

levain  O
sandwich.The  O
star  O
was  O
the  O
levain  O
bread  O
made  O
from  O
a  O
proprietary  O
yeast  O
starter  O
and  O
takes  O
18  O
days  O
to  O
make  O
.  O

The  O
bread  O
was  O
soft  O
and  O
fluffy  O
with  O
a  O
tangy  O
flavour  O
amid  O
a  O
hard  O
crispy  O
crust  O

The  O
Confit  O

Poitrine  O
de  O
Porc  O
(  O
$  O
36  O
)  O
or  O
simply  O
Pork  O
Belly  O
Confit  O
was  O
cured  O
in  O
a  O
mixture  O
of  O
sea  O
salt  O
,  O
brown  O
sugar  O
and  O
aromatics  O
,  O
and  O
then  O
cooked  O
,  O
covered  O
in  O
duck  O
fat  O
for  O
90  O
degrees  O
Celsius  O
over  O
12  O
hours  O
.  O

I  O
noticed  O
thecrackling  O
skin  O
was  O
abit  O
darker  O
in  O
colour  O
which  O
made  O
me  O
wonder  O
if  O
it  O
was  O
because  O
of  O
the  O
used  O
of  O
brown  O
sugar  O
during  O
the  O
curing  O
process.The  O
melted  O
in  O
the  O
mouth  O
pork  O
belly  O
was  O
served  O
with  O
garlic  O
mash  O
,  O
seasonal  O
vegetables  O
,  O
and  O
mustard  O
sauce  O
.  O

Bouchees  O
aux  O
fruits  O
de  O
mer  O
3.5/5  O

My  O
first  O
impression  O
of  O
theBouchees  O
aux  O
fruits  O
de  O
mer  O
(  O
$  O
30  O
)  O
resembles  O
the  O
chinese  O
yam  O
basket  O
.  O

The  O
puff  O
pastry  O
case  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
luxurious  O
seafood  O
medley  O
of  O
scallops  O
,  O
prawns  O
,  O
squid  O
and  O
mussels  O
sauteed  O
with  O
white  O
wine  O
and  O
cream  O
.  O

We  O
were  O
quite  O
impressed  O
that  O
the  O
pastry  O
was  O
cooked  O
perfectly  O
considering  O
the  O
number  O
of  O
layers  O
involved  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
,  O
I  O
felt  O
that  O
the  O
ingredients  O
did  O
n't  O
come  O
together  O
as  O
one  O
and  O
it  O
was  O
kind  O
of  O
complex  O
or  O
difficult  O
to  O
savour  O
the  O
seafood  O
and  O
pastry  O
as  O
a  O
whole  O
.  O

I  O
wouldgladly  O
havethe  O
seafood  O
and  O

separately  O

Prawn  O
Crumble  O
Pasta  O
4.5/5  O

The  O
Prawn  O
Crumble  O
Pasta  O
(  O
$  O
26  O
)  O
was  O
rather  O
unique  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

First  O
the  O
used  O
of  O
parsley  O
pesto  O
to  O
the  O
more  O
common  O
basil  O
pesto  O
.  O

Next  O
was  O
the  O
used  O
of  O
homemade  O
anchovy  O
crumble  O
that  O
was  O
sprinkled  O
on  O
top  O
of  O
the  O
pasta  O
.  O

Iwas  O
quite  O
impressed  O
with  O
the  O
pasta  O
that  O
had  O
both  O
textures  O
and  O
flavours  O
working  O
harmoniously  O
together  O
.  O

Besides  O
a  O
wide  O
repertoireof  O
savoury  O
items  O
,  O
Le  O

also  O
has  O
a  O
exquisite  O

of  O
desserts  O
that  O
Antoinette  O
is  O
well  O
known  O
for  O
amid  O
its  O
luxuriant  O
setting  O
.  O

After  O
a  O
hearty  O
meal  O
,  O
we  O
got  O
to  O
try  O
4  O
of  O
Chef  O
Pang  O

new  O
2012  O
collection  O
of  O

I  O
do  O
not  O
really  O
have  O
a  O
sweet  O
tooth  O
and  O
the  O
balance  O
of  O
sweetness  O
was  O
just  O
right  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

Chloe  O

is  O

Best  O

enjoy  O
with  O
a  O

to  O
wash  O
down  O
the  O
sweetness  O
.  O

Tarte  O
Exotique  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
Tarte  O
Exotique  O
(  O
$  O
8.50  O
)  O
was  O
probably  O
the  O
favourite  O
desserts  O
among  O
thefour  O
we  O
tried  O
.  O

A  O
luscious  O
gula  O
melaka  O
cremeux  O
,  O

and  O
a  O

mango  O
and  O
passion  O

The  O
technique  O
and  O
used  O
of  O
Asian  O
flavours  O
in  O
the  O
subtle  O
dessert  O
just  O
demonstrate  O
the  O
chef  O
's  O
talent  O
and  O
prowess  O
in  O
his  O
forte  O
.  O

since  O
I  O
have  O
never  O

themselves  O
in  O
an  O
array  O
of  O

Pork  O
Knuckles  O
and  O
Sausages  O

A  O
section  O
of  O
the  O
restaurant  O
just  O
behind  O
the  O
reception  O
is  O
dedicated  O
for  O
the  O
amazing  O
display  O
of  O
the  O

me  O
a  O
very  O

the  O
whole  O
setup  O
.  O

Roast  O
Tomahawk  O
Veal  O

The  O
huge  O
Roast  O
Tomahawk  O
Veal  O
was  O
the  O
most  O
eyes  O
catching  O
of  O
the  O
night  O
and  O
I  O
simply  O
could  O
n't  O
resist  O
having  O
a  O
slice  O
of  O
it  O
.  O

Look  O
at  O
all  O
the  O
lovely  O
and  O
beautiful  O
cuts  O
of  O
the  O
meats  O
from  O
the  O
various  O
Meet  O
the  O
Meat  O
selections  O
.  O

My  O
personal  O
favourite  O
was  O
the  O
sausages  O
,  O
beef  O
tenderloin  O
and  O
duck  O
confit  O
.  O

The  O
pork  O
knucles  O
and  O
lamb  O
were  O
good  O
too  O
...  O
oh  O
my  O
god  O
,  O
I  O
just  O
did  O
n't  O
have  O
the  O
stomach  O
to  O
eat  O
them  O
all  O
.  O

The  O
buffet  O
is  O
not  O
just  O
about  O
meat  O
.  O

Just  O
like  O

food  O
,  O
local  O
fare  O
and  O
desserts  O
too  O
.  O

The  O
laksa  O
is  O
a  O
MUST  O
TRY  O
here  O
.  O

The  O
laksa  O
broth  O
was  O
robust  O
with  O
dried  O
shrimp  O
flavour  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
sweet  O
tooth  O
,  O
a  O
decent  O
selection  O
of  O
desserts  O
are  O
available  O
on  O
the  O
buffet  O
spread  O
too  O
.  O

Worth  O

is  O
the  O
buffet  O
line  O
at  O
Silver  O
Shell  O
Cafe  O
has  O
a  O
section  O
specially  O
children  O
friendly  O
designed  O
.  O

Both  O
the  O
savoury  O

sweet  O
food  O
are  O
laid  O

For  O
the  O

the  O

using  O
a  O

of  O

The  O
Assorted  O
Seafood  O
in  O
imu  O
style  O
barbeque  O
was  O
my  O
favourite  O
for  O
the  O
night  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
rather  O
spicy  O
due  O
to  O
the  O
used  O
of  O
garlic  O
and  O
sambal  O
.  O

The  O
broth  O
was  O
thick  O
and  O
had  O
a  O
robust  O

The  O
Vertical  O

is  O
an  O
barbeque  O
technique  O
I  O
have  O
not  O
seen  O
.  O

The  O

were  O
cooked  O
by  O
the  O
heat  O
radiated  O
from  O
the  O

Normally  O
barbeque  O
it  O
is  O
quite  O
hard  O
to  O
control  O
the  O
fire  O
and  O
usually  O
you  O
will  O
end  O
up  O
with  O
charred  O
food  O

The  O
used  O
of  O

from  O

that  O
the  O

more  O
distinct  O
compared  O
to  O
the  O

flavour.The  O
beer  O
flavour  O
was  O
more  O
intense  O
in  O
the  O

instead  O

The  O

(  O

If  O
you  O

ask  O
me  O
for  O
a  O
recommendation  O
at  O

the  O

to  O

while  O
I  O
was  O
there  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O

There  O
were  O
many  O
mixed  O
reviews  O
on  O
Jian  O
Bo  O
Shui  O
Kueh  O
and  O
most  O
of  O
them  O
noticed  O
that  O
the  O
standard  O
and  O
quality  O
were  O
not  O
the  O
same  O
as  O
previous  O
.  O

They  O
could  O
be  O
right  O
as  O
the  O
original  O
owner  O
has  O
sold  O
the  O
stall  O
to  O
the  O
current  O
owner  O
(  O
accordingly  O
to  O
what  O
I  O
found  O
on  O

rather  O
fragrant  O

to  O

it  O

the  O

of  O

was  O
a  O
disappointment  O

were  O

Half  O
of  O
This  O
and  O
Half  O
of  O

I  O
find  O
it  O
very  O
thoughtful  O
for  O
Cafe  O
Epicurious  O
to  O
offer  O
the  O
Half  O
of  O
This  O
&  O
Half  O
of  O
That  O
(  O
$  O
16  O
)  O
on  O
its  O

for  O
those  O
that  O
is  O
indecisive  O
.  O

We  O
went  O
for  O
the  O
Green  O
Egg  O
&  O
Ham  O
and  O
Egg  O
Benedict  O
combination  O
.  O

The  O
green  O
egg  O
is  O

scrambled  O
egg  O
.  O

It  O
camewith  O
prosciutto  O
and  O
topped  O
with  O
parmigiano  O

.  O

The  O
basil  O
pesto  O
and  O
pramigiano  O
reggiano  O
lifted  O
the  O
flavours  O
of  O
the  O
moist  O
and  O
creamy  O
scrambled  O
eggs  O
.  O

The  O
poached  O
egg  O
was  O
cooked  O
to  O
perfection  O
with  O
the  O
egg  O
yolk  O
oozing  O
out  O
.  O

While  O
the  O
others  O
felt  O
that  O
the  O
hollandaise  O
sauce  O
was  O
a  O
tad  O
sour  O
,  O
I  O
actually  O
liked  O
that  O
mild  O
tang  O
taste  O
.  O

However  O
,  O
I  O
would  O
preferred  O
the  O
sauce  O
to  O
be  O
more  O
rich  O
and  O
buttery  O
.  O

Baked  O
Eggs  O

Soldiers  O

The  O
other  O
egg  O
dish  O
available  O
on  O

menu  O
is  O
the  O
Baked  O
Eggs  O
with  O
Toast  O
Soldiers  O
(  O
$  O
14  O
)  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
always  O
wanted  O
to  O
try  O
this  O
way  O
of  O
enjoying  O
egg  O
,  O
dipping  O
the  O
toast  O
into  O
the  O
creamy  O
and  O
cheesy  O
baked  O
egg  O
.  O

I  O
could  O
n't  O
help  O
to  O
associate  O
it  O
with  O
our  O
local  O
half  O
boiled  O
egg  O
.  O

Do  O
I  O
prefer  O
the  O
East  O
or  O
West  O
way  O
?  O

I  O
would  O
have  O
to  O
say  O
I  O
prefer  O
my  O
soy  O
sauce  O
and  O
pepper  O
over  O
cream  O
and  O
cheese  O
.  O

The  O
baked  O
eggs  O
was  O
good  O
and  O
I  O
only  O
blamed  O
it  O
that  O
I  O
am  O
born  O
with  O
an  O
Asian  O
palate  O
.  O

French  O
Toast  O

The  O

(  O

Balachan  O
Crab  O

The  O
dried  O

crab  O
came  O
with  O
lots  O
of  O
fried  O
shallots  O
and  O
some  O
curry  O
leaves  O
.  O

It  O
has  O
an  O
unique  O
spicy  O
and  O
salty  O
combination  O
which  O
was  O
good  O
but  O
not  O
fantastic  O
.  O

Salted  O

This  O
is  O
a  O

This  O
is  O
Irvin  O
's  O
specialty  O
with  O
Chef  O
Yap  O
's  O
special  O
recipe  O
.  O

I  O
liked  O
the  O
fact  O
that  O
curry  O
leaves  O
are  O
added  O
to  O
give  O
the  O
sauce  O
the  O
extra  O
kick  O
and  O
fragrant  O
.  O

The  O
crab  O
was  O
basically  O
swimming  O
in  O
the  O
generous  O
amount  O
of  O
salted  O
egg  O
sauce  O
.  O

The  O
salted  O
egg  O
sauce  O
is  O
so  O
well  O
received  O
by  O
the  O
customers  O
that  O
they  O
are  O
selling  O
it  O
at  O
$  O
12  O

freshly  O
made  O

I  O
should  O
get  O
a  O
box  O
for  O
my  O
nacho  O

coated  O
with  O
the  O

.  O

Again  O

The  O
Red  O

(  O

is  O
not  O

you  O
have  O
to  O
ask  O
the  O
waiter/waitress  O
for  O
it  O

The  O
fresh  O

Claypot  O
Pumpkin  O
Prawns  O
4/5  O

Our  O
palates  O
were  O
kind  O
of  O
tired  O
and  O
confused  O
with  O
all  O
the  O
salted  O
egg  O
and  O
butter  O
sauce  O
dishes  O
.  O

When  O
the  O
Claypot  O
Pumpkin  O
Prawns  O
(  O
$  O
13.80  O
small  O
,  O
$  O
22.80  O
large  O
)  O
was  O
served  O
,  O
we  O
needed  O
to  O
reconfirm  O
with  O
the  O
kitchen  O
that  O
they  O
have  O
not  O
used  O
the  O
salted  O
egg  O
sauce  O
instead  O
.  O

It  O
tasted  O
very  O
similar  O
to  O
the  O
salted  O
egg  O
sauce  O
except  O
that  O
the  O
texture  O
was  O
smoother  O
.  O

Same  O
technique  O
of  O
using  O
chilli  O
padi  O
and  O
curry  O
leaves  O
to  O
lift  O
the  O
flavours  O
.  O

Even  O
the  O
colour  O
looked  O
exactly  O
the  O
same  O
.  O

The  O
pumpkin  O
sauce  O
was  O
very  O
good  O
but  O
I  O
really  O
could  O
not  O
taste  O
the  O
distinct  O
pumpkin  O
flavour  O
.  O

Salted  O
French  O
Beans  O
4/5  O

Finally  O
some  O
greens  O
after  O
all  O
therich  O
and  O
creamy  O
dishes  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
how  O
the  O
Salted  O
French  O
Beans  O
(  O
$  O
10.80  O
small  O
,  O
$  O
15.80  O
large  O
)  O
still  O
had  O
the  O
crunchiness  O
texture  O
.  O

The  O
chilli  O
padi  O
,  O
dried  O
shrimps  O
and  O
fried  O
shallots  O
completed  O
the  O
flavours  O
making  O
it  O
a  O
light  O
and  O
delectable  O
dish  O
.  O

The  O

a  O

old  O
school  O
in  O
my  O

opinion  O

I  O

Oysters  O
4.5/5  O

Usually  O
when  O
I  O
went  O
for  O
buffet  O
,  O
I  O
will  O
start  O
with  O
the  O
cold  O
section  O
and  O
I  O
definitely  O
will  O
have  O
the  O
oysters  O
.  O

However  O
I  O
will  O
not  O
have  O
more  O
than  O
3  O
so  O
that  O
I  O
leave  O
space  O
for  O
the  O
other  O
buffet  O
spread  O
down  O
the  O
line  O
.  O

I  O
broke  O
the  O
rule  O
at  O
The  O
Square  O
and  O
went  O
back  O
for  O
another  O
4-5  O
serving  O
of  O
their  O
oysters  O
.  O

Although  O
the  O
cold  O
section  O
is  O
not  O
big  O
but  O
their  O
oysters  O
were  O
very  O
fresh  O
,  O
big  O
and  O
full  O
.  O

Cooked  O

4.2/5  O

The  O
lovely  O
cooked  O
Salmon  O
was  O
huge  O
too  O
.  O

The  O
fish  O
was  O
nicely  O
cooked  O
,  O

and  O
creamy  O
.  O

variety  O

indulging  O
you  O

Cheese  O
Risotto  O
4.5/5  O

I  O
felt  O
very  O
privileged  O
to  O
have  O
Chef  O
Jean-Philippe  O
cooking  O
personally  O
for  O
us  O
the  O
risotto  O
and  O
poached  O
cod  O
fish  O
.  O

The  O
risottowas  O
first  O
cooked  O
in  O
a  O
pan  O
,  O
transferred  O
andtossed  O
in  O
the  O
huge  O
parmasen  O
cheese  O
wheel  O
to  O
have  O
an  O
even  O
coating  O
of  O
cheese  O
on  O
each  O
grain  O
.  O

Simply  O
love  O
the  O
intense  O
and  O
rich  O
cheesy  O
flavours  O
of  O
the  O
Cheese  O
Risotto  O
.  O

The  O
rice  O
was  O
not  O
mushy  O
or  O
under  O
cooked  O
,  O
still  O
having  O
a  O
little  O
bit  O
to  O
it  O
.  O

Laksa  O
Risotto  O

Chef  O
Jean  O
Philippe  O
cooked  O
us  O
2  O
version  O
of  O
the  O
Laksa  O
Risotto  O
.  O

One  O
with  O
cheese  O
while  O
the  O
other  O
without  O
.  O

We  O
had  O
mixed  O
preference  O
and  O
I  O
preferred  O
the  O
one  O
without  O
cheese  O
.  O

For  O
me  O
the  O
cheese  O
confused  O
the  O
flavour  O
of  O
the  O
laksa  O
which  O
was  O
the  O
core  O
and  O
uniqueness  O
of  O
this  O
dish  O
.  O

Poached  O
Cod  O
Fillet  O
4.5/5  O

The  O
Poached  O
Cod  O
Fillet  O
(  O
$  O
34  O
)  O
is  O
available  O
on  O
the  O
ala  O
carte  O
menu  O
.  O

The  O
fresh  O
and  O
moist  O
cod  O
fillet  O
was  O
poached  O
in  O
spicy  O
coconut  O
and  O
prawn  O
broth  O
,  O
served  O
with  O
sauteed  O
vegetables  O
and  O
chicken  O
rice  O
.  O

I  O
liked  O
the  O
thick  O
and  O
creamy  O
gravy  O
which  O
had  O
a  O
nce  O
balance  O
of  O
sweetness  O
and  O
spiciness  O
,  O
making  O
it  O
very  O
addictive  O
.  O

Laksa  O
3.8/5  O

Like  O
all  O
hotel  O
buffet  O
line  O
,  O
thereare  O
also  O
live  O
stations  O
and  O
local  O
fares  O
.  O

I  O
love  O
laksa  O
and  O
I  O
always  O
made  O
a  O
point  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
Laksa  O
.  O

The  O
laksa  O
missed  O
its  O
mark  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

The  O
gravy  O
lacked  O
both  O
the  O
dried  O
shrimp  O
flavours  O
and  O
rich  O
coconut  O
cream  O
.  O

Most  O
people  O
would  O
leave  O
the  O
dessert  O
to  O
the  O
last  O
so  O
as  O
to  O
end  O
the  O
meal  O
on  O
a  O
sweet  O
note  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
the  O
same  O
for  O
me  O
too  O
.  O

The  O
Sqaure  O
does  O
offer  O
a  O
good  O
spread  O
of  O
delectable  O
desserts  O

Do  O
try  O
the  O
Durian  O
Pengat  O
and  O
Lemon  O

was  O
probably  O
more  O
than  O
5  O
years  O

My  O
memory  O
of  O
Tiong  O
BahruFood  O
Centre  O
was  O
bad  O
air  O

,  O
small  O
and  O
crowded  O
.  O

The  O
place  O
has  O
since  O
undergone  O
renovationand  O
now  O
it  O
is  O
more  O

There  O
were  O
many  O

Since  O
I  O
have  O
never  O
tried  O
the  O

I  O
ordered  O
a  O

queued  O
up  O
for  O

has  O
to  O
be  O
the  O
deep  O

.  O

The  O
shark  O
meat  O
was  O
surprisely  O
flavourful  O
and  O
moist  O
inside  O
the  O
crispy  O
fritter  O
.  O

Different  O
from  O
other  O
stalls  O
,  O
the  O
bowl  O
of  O
lor  O

did  O
not  O
have  O
the  O
usual  O

,  O

pork  O
and  O

.  O

I  O
also  O
found  O
the  O

lacked  O

You  O

My  O
mother  O
reads  O
the  O

and  O
I  O
like  O
to  O
browse  O
through  O
the  O
paper  O

column  O
.  O

It  O
always  O
introduced  O
local  O
fare  O
and  O
I  O
will  O
make  O
a  O
note  O
to  O
visit  O
them  O
if  O
I  O
came  O
across  O
an  O
interesting  O
stall  O
.  O

Recently  O
Anchor  O
Beer  O
has  O
a  O
contest  O
in  O
Wanbao  O
(  O
)  O
newspaper  O
nominated  O
by  O
their  O
readers  O
for  O
the  O
top  O
5  O
favourite  O
braised  O
duck  O
.  O

Seng  O
Kee  O
's  O
Braised  O
Duck  O
was  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
5  O
finalist  O
.  O

When  O
I  O
saw  O
the  O
address  O
,  O
I  O
realized  O
I  O
have  O
been  O
passing  O
by  O
this  O
stall  O
for  O
the  O
past  O
8  O
years  O
in  O
my  O
journey  O
home  O
from  O
work  O
and  O
I  O
have  O
never  O
eaten  O
there  O
.  O

Coincidentally  O
,  O
the  O
stall  O
belongs  O
Shiting  O
's  O
uncle  O
,  O
a  O
foodie  O
friend  O
of  O
mine.After  O
firing  O
a  O
few  O
text  O
messages  O
,  O
we  O
met  O
up  O
for  O
a  O
Sunday  O
lunch  O
with  O
Celes  O
and  O
Shiting  O

family  O

Braised  O
Duck  O
4.2/5  O

Since  O
Seng  O
Kee  O
was  O
the  O
top  O
5  O
finalist  O
for  O
their  O
braised  O
duck  O
,  O
definitely  O
we  O
must  O
taste  O
it  O
to  O
know  O
why  O
.  O

With  O
over  O
30  O
years  O
of  O
braising  O
experience  O
,  O
no  O
wonder  O
the  O
Braised  O
Duck  O
(  O
$  O
10  O
)  O
came  O
with  O
the  O
taste  O
of  O
tradition  O
,  O
similar  O
to  O
how  O
my  O
grandma  O
would  O
have  O
done  O
it  O
when  O
she  O
was  O
around  O
.  O

Not  O
overly  O
intense  O
in  O
flavours  O
,  O
just  O
simple  O
and  O
light  O
but  O
tasty  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
like  O
the  O
fact  O
that  O
the  O
duck  O
was  O
not  O
too  O
fat  O
with  O
just  O
a  O
slight  O
thin  O
layer  O
of  O
fats  O
underneath  O
the  O
skin  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
are  O
there  O
for  O
just  O
a  O
simple  O
lunch  O
,  O
a  O
plate  O
of  O
duck  O
rice  O
will  O
cost  O
$  O
3  O
while  O
the  O
boneless  O
duck  O
rice  O
is  O
$  O
3.50  O

Assorted  O
Braised  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
stall  O
also  O
sells  O
a  O
selection  O
of  O
assorted  O
braised  O
.  O

We  O
tried  O
the  O
Assorted  O
Braised  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
that  O
came  O
with  O
Tau  O

Not  O

braised  O

nowadays.I  O
really  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
texture  O
and  O
well  O
braised  O

of  O
it  O
.  O

Roast  O
Duck  O
4.5  O

The  O
braised  O
duck  O
was  O
already  O
good  O
but  O
I  O
like  O
Seng  O
Kee  O
's  O
Roast  O
Duck  O
(  O
$  O
10  O
)  O
even  O
more  O
.  O

Once  O
again  O
the  O
duck  O
was  O
not  O
too  O
fat  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
thin  O
crisp  O
of  O
skin  O
over  O
thesucculent  O
and  O
tender  O

The  O
Roast  O
Pork  O

(  O
$  O

)  O
are  O
the  O
other  O
roasted  O
meat  O
that  O
is  O
available  O
at  O
the  O
stall  O
.  O

I  O
loved  O
the  O
roast  O
pork  O
with  O
the  O
crackling  O
crisp  O
skin  O
and  O
the  O
beautiful  O
layers  O
of  O
meat  O
and  O
fats  O
.  O

The  O
stall  O
used  O
lean  O
meat  O
for  O
the  O
Char  O
Siew  O
after  O
feedback  O
from  O
their  O
customers  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
preferred  O
it  O
to  O
be  O
more  O
fat  O
and  O
charred  O

I  O
am  O
surprised  O
that  O
the  O

also  O
sells  O
Pork  O
Ribs  O
&  O
Chicken  O
Wings  O
(  O
$  O
4.20  O

The  O
chicken  O
wing  O
is  O
at  O

1.20  O
per  O
piece  O
and  O
the  O
pork  O
ribs  O
$  O
34  O
per  O

.  O

The  O
stall  O
is  O
only  O
run  O
by  O
2  O
gentlemen  O
and  O
they  O
have  O
to  O
roast  O

meats  O
all  O
by  O
themselves  O
in  O
the  O

The  O

will  O
love  O
the  O

and  O
chicken  O
wings  O
with  O
the  O
lovely  O

For  O
over  O
70  O
years  O
,  O
they  O
continued  O
to  O
make  O

painstakingly  O
by  O

using  O
a  O

down  O
by  O

pressed  O
it  O

When  O

There  O
are  O
so  O
many  O
nice  O
places  O
to  O
eat  O
in  O
JB  O
,  O
so  O
it  O

a  O
big  O

Ive  O
decided  O
to  O

just  O
5  O
of  O
my  O

places  O

are  O
all  O
within  O
10  O
minutes  O
of  O

There  O
are  O
a  O
few  O
more  O
good  O
eating  O
places  O
within  O
10  O
minutes  O
walk  O
in  O
JBs  O
old  O
downtown  O
area  O
.  O

Here  O
is  O
the  O
sketch  O
map  O
of  O
where  O
my  O
5  O
favourite  O
places  O
are  O
located  O
.  O

After  O
clearing  O
immigration  O
,  O
walk  O
out  O
of  O
City  O
Square  O
shopping  O
centre  O
and  O
go  O
onto  O
the  O
main  O
street  O
,  O
Jalan  O
Wong  O
Ah  O
Fook  O
.  O

.  O

Walk  O
along  O
Jalan  O
Wong  O
Ah  O
Fook  O
and  O
head  O
towards  O
the  O
direction  O
of  O
Singapore  O
.  O

Look  O
out  O
for  O
this  O
Hindu  O
temple  O
along  O
Jalan  O
Ungku  O
Puan  O
,  O
which  O
you  O
can  O
use  O
as  O
a  O
reference  O
point  O
.  O

Then  O
follow  O
the  O
directions  O
on  O
the  O
sketch  O
map  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
are  O
there  O
early  O
and  O
need  O
a  O
morning  O
coffee  O
,  O
I  O
suggest  O
you  O
can  O
try  O
the  O
coffee  O
and  O
half  O
boiled  O
eggs  O
at  O
Kin  O
Wah  O
coffee  O
shop  O
.  O

The  O
traditional  O
office  O
here  O
is  O
full  O
bodied  O
and  O
robustly  O
flavoured  O
.  O

The  O
perfectly  O
done  O
half  O
boiled  O
eggs  O
here  O
are  O
made  O
from  O
kampung  O
chicken  O
eggs  O
.  O

The  O
eggs  O
have  O
a  O
heavier  O
texture  O
and  O
more  O
distinct  O
aroma  O
of  O
fresh  O
eggs  O
.  O

This  O
Hainanese  O
kopitiam  O
is  O
packed  O
the  O
whole  O
day  O
with  O
customers  O
of  O
all  O
races  O
and  O
from  O
all  O
walks  O
of  O
life  O
.  O

I  O
havent  O
tried  O
their  O
toast  O
buns  O
and  O
breads  O
myself  O
but  O
I  O
can  O
see  O
that  O
they  O
are  O
very  O
popular  O
.  O

Many  O
people  O
also  O
order  O
their  O
mee  O
siam  O
here  O
.  O

Business  O
can  O
get  O
very  O
hectic  O
here  O
and  O
the  O
harried  O
staff  O
can  O
be  O
a  O
bit  O
on  O
edge  O
.  O

A  O
short  O
walk  O
away  O
is  O
Ah  O
Hua  O
kway  O
teow  O
soup  O
.  O

This  O
old  O
shop  O
has  O
been  O
here  O
for  O
a  O
long  O
time  O
and  O
is  O
today  O
run  O
by  O
the  O
third  O
generation  O
.  O

They  O
still  O
use  O
charcoal  O
to  O
boil  O
the  O
soup  O
stock  O
something  O
that  O
I  O
have  O
not  O
seen  O
anywhere  O
else  O
.  O

RM16  O
gets  O
you  O
the  O
Kings  O
version  O
loaded  O
with  O
abalone  O
,  O
fresh  O
oysters  O
and  O
all  O
the  O
extra  O
luxuries  O
.  O

Personally  O
,  O
I  O
am  O
perfectly  O
happy  O
with  O
the  O
basic  O
RM5  O
version  O
to  O
savour  O
the  O
old  O
traditional  O
flavours  O
of  O
Teochew  O
kway  O
teow  O
soup  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
like  O
Western  O
,  O
I  O
suggest  O
you  O
try  O
IT  O
Roo  O
cafe  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
another  O
very  O
old  O
Hainanese  O
caf  O
and  O
it  O
is  O
famed  O
for  O
their  O
chicken  O
chops  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O
chop  O
comes  O
in  O
a  O
big  O
slab  O
of  O
thigh  O
,  O
crispy  O
on  O
the  O
outside  O
and  O
moist  O
and  O
juicy  O
inside  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O
chop  O
comes  O
with  O
their  O
addictive  O
fresh  O
mushroom  O
sauce  O
.  O

Be  O
early  O
as  O
IT  O
Roo  O
is  O
always  O
packed  O
during  O
lunch  O
and  O
you  O
may  O
have  O
to  O
wait  O
for  O
your  O
seat  O
.  O

In  O
the  O
same  O
area  O
is  O
Hiap  O
Joo  O
bakery  O
.  O

This  O
traditional  O
bakery  O
still  O
uses  O
their  O
old  O
wood  O
fired  O
oven  O
to  O
bake  O
their  O
cakes  O
and  O
pastries  O
.  O

Hiap  O
Joos  O
banana  O
cake  O
is  O
very  O
popular  O
.  O

Go  O
inside  O
the  O
shop  O
and  O
you  O
will  O
see  O
the  O
huge  O
charcoal  O
oven  O
,  O
and  O
all  O
the  O
fresh  O
ingredients  O
like  O
combs  O
of  O
bananas  O
used  O
to  O
make  O
the  O
cakes  O
.  O

No  O
artificial  O
flavouring  O
is  O
used  O
here  O
.  O

You  O
can  O
taste  O
the  O
difference  O
,  O
instantly  O
.  O

I  O
always  O
bring  O
home  O
something  O
from  O
Hiap  O
Joo  O
whenever  O
I  O
pass  O
by  O
this  O
shop  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
stay  O
beyond  O
5:00pm  O
,  O
try  O
this  O
BBQ  O
chicken  O
stall  O
in  O
Meldrum  O
Walk  O
.  O

Medrum  O
Walk  O
is  O
a  O
back  O
lane  O
food  O
paradise  O
something  O
we  O
can  O
not  O
find  O
anywhere  O
in  O
Singapore  O
anymore  O
.  O

There  O
are  O
many  O
good  O
food  O
stalls  O
here  O
and  O
my  O
favourite  O
is  O
the  O
BBQ  O
chicken  O
stall  O
.  O

The  O
fresh  O
charcoal  O
roasted  O
chicken  O
literally  O
drips  O
with  O
sweet  O
natural  O
juices  O
.  O

The  O
juice  O
was  O
so  O
good  O
,  O
I  O
actually  O
felt  O
bad  O
that  O
some  O
of  O
it  O
inevitably  O
dripped  O
onto  O
the  O
plate  O
when  O
I  O
bite  O
into  O
it  O
such  O
a  O
waste  O
J  O
There  O
are  O
many  O
other  O
good  O
food  O
stalls  O
and  O
shops  O
to  O
try  O
out  O
when  O
you  O
are  O
in  O
JB  O
.  O

JB  O
is  O
generally  O
safe  O
but  O
please  O
do  O
be  O
alert  O
and  O
take  O
the  O
usual  O
precautions  O
e.g  O
.  O

move  O
away  O
when  O
approached  O
by  O
Scratch  O
and  O
Win  O
scammers  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
easy  O
to  O
enjoy  O
JB  O
food  O
with  O
a  O
little  O
bit  O
of  O
knowledge  O
of  O
where  O
the  O
good  O
eating  O
places  O
are  O
J  O
.  O

Wish  O
you  O
happy  O
eating  O
.  O

I  O
had  O
a  O
myVillage  O
mall  O
dining  O
voucher  O
to  O
spend  O
before  O
it  O
expired.After  O
looking  O
through  O
the  O
list  O
of  O
restaurants  O
in  O
the  O
mall  O
,  O
I  O
decided  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
Relish  O
with  O
my  O
partner  O
on  O
a  O
Sunday  O
afternoon  O
.  O

Relish  O
is  O
a  O
restaurant  O
under  O
the  O
Wild  O
Rocket  O
Group  O
andowned  O
by  O
Chef  O
Willin  O
known  O
for  O
his  O
Asian-western  O
fusion  O
creation  O
.  O

Mocha  O
and  O
Coconut  O
&  O
Gula  O
Melaka  O
Milkshake  O
4.2/5  O

We  O
started  O
with  O
drinks  O
.  O

I  O
ordered  O
the  O
Coconut  O
&  O
Gula  O
Melaka  O
Milkshake  O
(  O
$  O
8.00  O
)  O
as  O
I  O
never  O
had  O
it  O
before  O
.  O

The  O
name  O
itself  O
also  O
aroused  O
my  O
interest  O
.  O

The  O
interesting  O
combination  O
of  O
flavours  O
was  O
surprisingly  O
very  O
good  O
which  O
I  O
can  O
distinctly  O
identified  O
the  O
individual  O
core  O
flavours  O
.  O

Sarawak  O
Shepherds  O
Pie  O
4.2/5  O

My  O
partner  O
had  O
the  O
Sarawak  O
Shepherds  O
Pie  O
(  O
$  O
16.80  O
)  O
that  O
has  O
curry  O
chicken  O
inside  O
the  O
bed  O
of  O
mashed  O
potato  O
.  O

We  O
all  O
know  O
and  O
loveourAsian  O
curry  O
and  O
potato  O
.  O

Interestingly  O
,  O
the  O
chef  O
has  O
infusedthem  O
into  O
a  O
western  O
dish  O
.  O

There  O
was  O
a  O
good  O
harmony  O
with  O
the  O
ingredients  O
and  O
flavours  O
,  O
not  O
stealling  O
the  O
show  O
from  O
each  O
other  O
.  O

We  O
really  O
applauded  O
the  O
creation  O
and  O
we  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
dish  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
love  O
to  O
have  O
it  O
again  O
in  O
my  O
next  O
visit  O
.  O

Wild  O
Rocket  O
Beef  O
Burger  O
110g  O
4/5  O

Relish  O
is  O
known  O
for  O
its  O
burgers  O
before  O
it  O
introduced  O
other  O
hearty  O
mains  O
in  O
the  O
menu  O
.  O

Going  O
back  O
to  O
what  O
they  O
are  O
popular  O
for  O
,  O
I  O
decided  O
to  O
try  O
their  O
Wild  O
Rocket  O
Beef  O
Burger  O
110g  O
(  O
$  O
10.90  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
burger  O
came  O
with  O
sun-dried  O
tomatoes  O
,  O
rockets  O
and  O
Sarawak  O
pepper  O
cream  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
just  O
the  O
right  O
size  O
that  O
can  O
be  O
handled  O
with  O
ease  O
.  O

When  O
I  O
saw  O
the  O
patty  O
,  O
I  O
thought  O
it  O
looked  O
overcooked  O
and  O
dry  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
wronged  O
.  O

Biting  O
it  O
into  O
,  O
the  O
juiciness  O
started  O
oozing  O
out  O
from  O
the  O
patty  O
and  O
dripping  O
onto  O
my  O
hand  O
.  O

The  O
disappointment  O
for  O
me  O
is  O
the  O
way  O
the  O
restaruant  O
charges  O
for  O
any  O
add  O
on  O
to  O
the  O
burger  O
.  O

The  O
sunny  O
side  O
up  O
cost  O
me  O
an  O
additioal  O
$  O
1.80  O
which  O
I  O
probably  O
can  O
buya  O
dozen  O
of  O
it  O
.  O

I  O
always  O

I  O
tried  O
the  O
You  O
Tiao  O
which  O
is  O
also  O
known  O
as  O
chinese  O
crullers  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
crisp  O
on  O
the  O
outside  O
and  O
tender  O
inside  O

it  O

(  O

-  O
$  O

)  O
were  O
the  O
first  O
to  O
catch  O
my  O
attention  O
.  O

The  O
chunky  O
fresh  O
fruits  O
,  O
the  O
soft  O
sponge  O
and  O
the  O
light  O
fresh  O
cream  O
were  O
like  O
a  O
beautiful  O
art  O
piece  O
thatwas  O
pure  O
visual  O
enjoyment.The  O
cakes  O
were  O
not  O
overly  O
sweet  O
and  O
the  O
lightness  O
in  O
both  O
flavour  O
and  O
texture  O
were  O
very  O
delectable  O
.  O

.  O

I  O
am  O
not  O
really  O
a  O

lover  O
because  O
I  O
always  O
find  O
them  O
too  O
sweet  O
,  O
creamy  O
and  O
heavy  O
.  O

I  O
think  O
Naomi  O

has  O
changed  O

)  O
at  O
Naomi  O
Kitchen  O
brought  O
thetraditional  O

to  O
a  O
new  O
level  O
.  O

Before  O
my  O
visit  O
to  O
Naomi  O
Kitchen  O
,  O
I  O
only  O
know  O
of  O
the  O
popular  O
Swiss  O
Roll  O
and  O
Sugar  O
Roll  O
from  O
Polar  O
Cafe  O
.  O

Now  O
the  O
conventional  O
rolls  O
have  O
been  O
injected  O
with  O
more  O
flavours  O
and  O
creativity  O
.  O

Thecottony  O
softsponge  O
rolled  O
up  O
with  O
fresh  O
cream  O
and  O
chunk  O
of  O
fruits  O
or  O
nuts  O
in  O
the  O
middle  O
were  O
distinctly  O
flavourful  O
and  O
not  O
overly  O
sweet  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
are  O
looking  O
for  O
something  O
unique  O
,  O
try  O
the  O
Strawberry  O
Mango  O
Pudding  O
Fruit  O
Roll  O
.  O

Who  O
would  O
have  O
imagine  O
you  O
can  O
have  O
both  O
fruit  O
and  O
pudding  O
inside  O
a  O
sponge  O
roll  O
.  O

Grape  O
Cheese  O
Cake  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
Grape  O
Cheese  O
Cake  O
(  O
$  O
2.20  O
)  O
has  O
a  O
sponge  O
base  O
topped  O
with  O
a  O
thin  O
layer  O
of  O
jellyand  O
grapes  O
.  O

The  O
cheese  O
cake  O
was  O
rather  O
different  O
and  O
did  O
not  O
taste  O
very  O
cheesy  O
at  O
all  O
.  O

Even  O
the  O
texture  O
was  O
different.It  O
was  O
more  O
like  O
a  O
mousse  O
cake  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
I  O
still  O
enjoyed  O
it  O
a  O
lot  O
.  O

Tiramisu  O
4/5  O

If  O
you  O
do  O
not  O
like  O
your  O
Tiramisu  O
to  O
be  O
too  O
strong  O
on  O
the  O
liquor  O
or  O
too  O
heavy  O
on  O
the  O
coffee  O
flavour  O
,  O
you  O
will  O
probably  O
like  O
the  O
Tiramisu  O
(  O
$  O
4.50  O
)  O
at  O
Naomi  O
Kitchen  O
.  O

It  O
did  O
not  O
have  O
the  O
intense  O
flavours  O
which  O
was  O
light  O
and  O
easy  O
for  O
the  O
palate  O
.  O

Sheperd  O
Pie  O
4/5  O

The  O
Sheperd  O
Pie  O
(  O
$  O
2.80  O
)  O
comes  O
with  O
delectable  O
chicken  O
chunks  O
,  O
carrots  O
,  O
celery  O
,  O
mushrooms  O
and  O
onions  O
topped  O
with  O
creamy  O
mash  O
potato  O
and  O
cheese  O
.  O

The  O
one  O
I  O
had  O
is  O
the  O
regular  O
size  O
.  O

It  O
also  O
comes  O
in  O
petite  O
size  O
and  O
party  O
portion  O
for  O
6-8  O
pax  O
.  O

Tart  O

Another  O
popular  O
item  O
at  O
Naomi  O

is  O

are  O
Blueberry  O

The  O
winner  O
for  O
me  O
is  O

I  O
stay  O
in  O

but  O
I  O
seldom  O
eat  O
in  O

.  O

It  O
is  O
a  O
kind  O
of  O

is  O
n't  O
it  O
?  O

Anyway  O
,  O
cut  O
the  O
story  O
short  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
at  O
Hougang  O
Mall  O
looking  O
for  O
lunch  O
and  O
I  O
decided  O
to  O
dine  O
at  O
the  O
Mei  O
Shi  O
Mei  O
Ke  O
Food  O
Court  O
by  O
Kopitiam  O
at  O

The  O
decor  O
of  O
the  O
food  O
courthas  O
a  O
very  O
chinese  O
theme  O
.  O

The  O
calligraphy  O
on  O
the  O

nursery  O
rhymes  O
impressed  O
me  O
most  O
.  O

Xin  O
Hua  O

Mee  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
headache  O
about  O
eating  O
at  O
food  O
court  O
is  O
that  O
there  O
are  O
so  O
many  O
choices  O
.  O

After  O
I  O
have  O
recce  O
the  O

I  O
decided  O
to  O
have  O
the  O

andthe  O

I  O
am  O
getting  O
,  O
I  O
find  O
it  O
value  O
for  O
money  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
to  O
add  O
a  O
bit  O
of  O
vinegar  O
to  O
give  O
the  O

extra  O

When  O
I  O
was  O
invited  O
by  O
Fan  O
Play  O
to  O
try  O
out  O
their  O
Chee  O
Cheong  O
Fan  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
asking  O
myself  O
will  O
I  O
be  O
full  O
?  O

What  O
is  O
so  O
special  O
about  O
it  O
?  O

Is  O
there  O
a  O
post  O
angle  O
for  O
my  O
readers  O
?  O

I  O
guess  O
you  O
probably  O
have  O
the  O
same  O
questions  O
in  O
your  O
head  O
now  O
.  O

Well  O
,  O
I  O
have  O
to  O
say  O
I  O
was  O
totally  O
wrong  O
about  O
it.Glad  O
thatI  O
went  O
down  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O
Cheong  O
Fan  O
and  O
I  O
can  O
proudly  O
share  O
this  O
post  O
with  O
you  O
.  O

Fan  O
Play  O
is  O
actually  O
located  O
inside  O
Carrefour  O
at  O
the  O
Deli  O
section  O
on  O
level  O
1  O
.  O

The  O
short  O
cutis  O
to  O
cut  O
through  O
the  O
cashier  O
counters  O
,  O
turn  O
right  O
and  O
walk  O
all  O
the  O
way  O
to  O
the  O
end  O
.  O

Patrons  O
can  O
actually  O
take  O
away  O
or  O
dine  O
inside  O
Carrefour  O
.  O

There  O
is  O
a  O
stand  O
up  O
dining  O
area  O
with  O
some  O
tall  O
tables  O

Beer  O
Battered  O
Dory  O
with  O
Brown  O
Sauce  O
4.5/5  O

Robert  O
the  O
owner  O
told  O
us  O
that  O
the  O
Cheong  O
Fan  O
is  O
specially  O
imported  O
from  O
Ipoh  O
twice  O
weekly  O
which  O
the  O
historic  O
town  O
is  O
famous  O
for  O
.  O

He  O
tried  O
manufacturing  O
it  O
in  O
Singapore  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
not  O
as  O
good  O
.  O

He  O
said  O
the  O
water  O
used  O
in  O
Ipoh  O
is  O
different  O
and  O
hence  O
the  O
difference  O
in  O
texture  O
.  O

Besides  O
the  O
authentic  O
Ipoh  O
Cheong  O
Fan  O
,  O
Fan  O
Play  O
also  O
introduces  O
savory  O
gravies  O
atop  O
thesilky  O
smooth  O
Cheong  O
Fan  O
.  O

When  O
the  O
Beer  O
Battered  O
Dory  O
with  O
Brown  O
Sauce  O
(  O
$  O
4.50  O
)  O
was  O
served  O
,  O
my  O
first  O
thoughtwas  O
this  O
is  O
Hor  O
Fun  O
not  O
Cheong  O
Fan  O
.  O

Robert  O
explained  O
that  O
it  O
is  O
indeed  O
authentic  O
Ipoh  O
Cheong  O
Fan  O
as  O
it  O
is  O
made  O
from  O
rice  O
flour  O
and  O
water  O
only  O
.  O

I  O
mentioned  O
earlier  O
that  O
I  O
was  O
sceptical  O
whether  O
I  O
will  O
be  O
full  O
since  O
Cheong  O
Fan  O
is  O
usually  O
eaten  O
as  O
a  O
snack  O
.  O

Look  O
at  O
the  O
serving  O
,  O
it  O
is  O

They  O

all  O
very  O

.  O

If  O
I  O

to  O

,  O
I  O
would  O
go  O
for  O
the  O
fish  O

meat  O
wrapped  O
in  O

as  O
my  O
favourite  O
.  O

I  O
shared  O
with  O
the  O
chef  O
that  O
the  O
Laksa  O
gravy  O
was  O
very  O
nice  O
and  O
I  O
can  O
taste  O
the  O
distinct  O
dried  O
shrimp  O
flavours  O
.  O

In  O
simple  O
word  O
,  O
it  O
simply  O
taste  O
like  O
laksa  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
,  O
I  O
thought  O
that  O
cheong  O
fan  O
felt  O
separated  O
as  O
it  O
didn'tabsorb  O
the  O
gravy  O
.  O

The  O
chef  O
was  O
very  O
receptive  O
and  O
even  O
suggestedserving  O
in  O
a  O
bowl  O
with  O
more  O
laksa  O
gravy  O
andtweaking  O
the  O
texture  O
by  O
having  O
the  O
cheong  O
fan  O
in  O
smaller  O
pieces  O
.  O

I  O
look  O
forward  O
to  O
them  O
refining  O
the  O
dish.If  O
they  O
can  O
get  O
the  O
formulae  O
right  O
,  O
it  O
will  O
be  O
a  O
hit  O
with  O
the  O
local  O

Sar  O
Kok  O
Liew  O
(  O
Stuffed  O
Yambean  O
)  O
4.2/5  O

This  O
is  O
my  O
first  O
encounter  O
with  O
the  O
famous  O
Ipoh  O
Sar  O
Kok  O
Liew  O
or  O
known  O
as  O
Stuffed  O
Yambean  O
(  O
$  O
0.50/pc  O
)  O
.  O

Accordingly  O
to  O
the  O
chef  O
,  O
this  O
is  O
very  O
labour  O
intensive  O
and  O
availability  O
is  O
subjected  O
to  O
his  O
mood  O
.  O

Many  O
layers  O
of  O
textures  O
await  O
you  O
as  O
you  O
bite  O
into  O
it  O
.  O

The  O
crisp  O
from  O
the  O
outer  O
layer  O
,  O
the  O
chewy  O
texture  O
that  O
felt  O
like  O
eating  O
nian  O
gao  O
and  O
the  O
crunchy  O
juicy  O
chopped  O
bitesof  O
the  O
stuffed  O

was  O
something  O
very  O
enjoyable  O
that  O
one  O
is  O
never  O
enough  O

The  O

astronger  O
soya  O

compared  O
to  O
most  O
which  O
I  O
enjoyed  O

In  O

I  O
like  O

eating  O

is  O
never  O

in  O
me  O
.  O

The  O
whole  O

as  O

to  O

not  O

I  O
went  O
for  O
the  O

I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O

,  O
the  O

I  O

I  O
was  O
so  O

after  O
that  O
.  O

It  O
comes  O
with  O
choice  O
of  O
2  O
grills  O

6  O

Anyway  O
,  O
I  O
got  O
to  O
try  O

and  O
ordered  O
the  O
Grilled  O
Salsa  O
Duck  O
and  O
Buttered  O
Seared  O
Pacific  O

.  O

I  O
was  O
quite  O
surprised  O
how  O
flavourful  O
and  O
tender  O
the  O
duck  O
meat  O
was  O
.  O

It  O
definitely  O
won  O
me  O
over  O
.  O

The  O
buttered  O
seared  O
pacific  O
dory  O
was  O
as  O
good  O
too  O
.  O

The  O
buttery  O
flavour  O
over  O
the  O
soft  O
and  O
moist  O
fish  O
with  O
a  O
hint  O
of  O
herby  O
parsley  O
flavour  O
was  O
simply  O
heavenly  O
.  O

Is  O
the  O
grill  O
and  O
salad  O
really  O
that  O
good  O
?  O

Well  O
,  O
it  O
definitely  O
has  O
a  O
place  O
in  O
my  O
heart  O
and  O
I  O
actually  O
went  O
back  O
for  O
the  O
third  O

Little  O

I  O
know  O
that  O

Crispy  O

A  O
lot  O
of  O

do  O
not  O

Bean-Jal  O
(  O

,  O

)  O
will  O
probably  O
change  O
their  O
mind  O
.  O

The  O
brinjal  O
was  O
thinly  O
sliced  O
and  O
fried  O
to  O
crisp  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
coated  O
with  O
a  O
special  O
made  O
sweet  O
sauce  O
with  O
a  O
tab  O
of  O
spiciness  O
.  O

Even  O
not  O

folded  O
,  O
I  O
could  O
tell  O
that  O
I  O
am  O
eating  O

The  O
Kyoto  O
Pork  O
Ribs  O
(  O
$  O
20  O
)  O
was  O
served  O
wrapped  O
in  O
aluminum  O
foil  O
.  O

The  O
aluminum  O
foil  O
was  O
drenched  O
with  O
rose  O
wine  O
and  O
ignited  O
with  O
fire  O
upon  O
servicing  O
allowing  O
the  O
aroma  O
to  O
infuse  O
into  O
the  O
sauteed  O
pork  O
.  O

The  O
mixed  O
of  O
soury  O
and  O
sweetness  O
made  O
the  O
dish  O
very  O
delectable  O
.  O

Assam  O

The  O
signature  O
Assam  O
Fish  O
Head  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
definitely  O
packed  O
a  O
punch  O
.  O

According  O
to  O
the  O
owner  O
,  O
the  O
red  O
snapper  O
fish  O
head  O
is  O
hand  O
picked  O
from  O
the  O
market  O
daily  O
.  O

She  O
also  O
told  O
us  O
that  O

mild  O
the  O

after  O
feedback  O
from  O
customers.The  O
perfect  O
balance  O
of  O
flavours  O
of  O
the  O
assam  O
fish  O
head  O
definitely  O
is  O
the  O
best  O
I  O
have  O
eaten  O
and  O
it  O
is  O
a  O
must  O
try  O
.  O

Hot  O
Plate  O
Sambal  O
Seabass  O
3.8/5  O

Serving  O
a  O
deep  O
fried  O
Seabass  O
on  O
a  O
hot  O
plate  O
is  O
a  O
bit  O
weird  O
to  O
me  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
preferredit  O
to  O
be  O
steamed  O
rather  O
than  O
deep  O
fried  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
the  O
Hot  O
Plate  O
Sambal  O
Seabass  O
(  O
$  O
25  O
)  O
was  O
lovely  O
with  O
the  O
sambal  O
sauce  O
.  O

If  O
only  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
spicer  O
would  O
be  O
nice  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
the  O
most  O
generous  O
Oyster  O
Omelette  O
(  O
$  O
12  O
)  O
I  O
have  O
ever  O
eaten  O
.  O

The  O
oyster  O
was  O
big  O
and  O
fresh  O
.  O

Interestingly  O
,  O
it  O
came  O
with  O
sambal  O
sauce  O
which  O
married  O
very  O
well  O
with  O
the  O
omelette  O
.  O

Prawn  O

The  O
huge  O

Prawn  O

(  O
$  O
8  O

8pc  O
,  O
$  O
16  O

)  O
was  O
crisp  O
on  O
the  O
outside  O
and  O
meaty  O
in  O
the  O
inside  O
with  O
a  O
hint  O
of  O
crunchy  O
texture  O
from  O
the  O

The  O
Special  O
Made  O
Tofu  O
with  O
Lingzhi  O
Mushroom  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
is  O
made  O
by  O
the  O
chef  O
using  O
egg  O
and  O
soya  O
bean  O
.  O

The  O
Tofu  O
was  O
silky  O
smooth  O
and  O
with  O
the  O
savoury  O
sauce  O
,  O
the  O
simple  O
tofu  O
dish  O
was  O
simply  O
delish  O
!  O

Thai  O
Style  O
Beancurd  O
3.8/5  O

Compared  O
to  O
the  O
Special  O
Made  O
Tofu  O
,  O
the  O
Thai  O
Style  O
Beancurd  O
(  O
$  O
6  O
for  O
6pc  O
)  O
was  O
firmer  O
and  O
less  O
silky  O
as  O
the  O
beancurd  O
was  O
bought  O
from  O
the  O
market  O
and  O
not  O
self  O
made  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
the  O
sweet  O
thai  O
sauce  O
gave  O
the  O
bland  O
beancurd  O
a  O
lovely  O
dimension  O
.  O

Cereal  O

Curry  O
Flavour  O
3.8/5  O

The  O
Cereal  O
Sotong  O
with  O
Curry  O
Flavour  O
(  O
$  O
20  O
,  O
$  O
30  O
,  O
$  O
40  O
)  O
was  O
rather  O
unique  O
.  O

The  O
curry  O
leaves  O
lifted  O
the  O
flavour  O
to  O
another  O
level  O
.  O

However  O
I  O
thought  O
the  O
cereal  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
bitter  O
not  O
sure  O
whether  O
it  O
was  O
over  O
done  O
.  O

I  O
preferred  O
the  O
cereal  O
to  O
be  O
sweeter  O
with  O
a  O
buttery  O
taste  O
.  O

The  O
big  O
and  O
succulent  O
Butter  O
Baked  O
Salted  O
Egg  O
Sri  O
Lanka  O
Crabs  O
(  O
seasonal  O
price  O
)  O
was  O
simply  O
finger  O
licking  O
good  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
the  O
dry  O
version  O
of  O
the  O
butter  O
baked  O
salted  O
egg  O
crabs  O
as  O
it  O
was  O
not  O
messy  O
to  O
eat  O
with  O
.  O

The  O
crab  O
meat  O
was  O
also  O
sweet  O
,  O
firm  O
and  O
juicy  O
.  O

Herbal  O
Chicken  O
Soup  O

I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
Herbal  O
Chicken  O
Soup  O
(  O
$  O
8.80  O
)  O
a  O
lot  O
.  O

Although  O
the  O
bowl  O
of  O
soup  O
was  O
packed  O
with  O
herbs  O
,  O
it  O
did  O
n't  O
taste  O
bitter  O
.  O

The  O
soup  O
was  O
light  O
and  O
refreshing  O
.  O

the  O
Black  O

dessert  O
.  O

Black  O
Glutinuos  O
is  O
one  O
of  O
my  O
favourite  O
desserts  O
.  O

Instead  O
of  O
coconut  O
milk  O
,  O
the  O
vanilla  O
ice  O
cream  O
was  O
a  O
good  O
alternative  O
and  O
also  O
act  O
as  O
a  O
sort  O
of  O
sweetner  O
to  O
complete  O
the  O
dish  O
