we  O
tired  O
the  O

.  O

I  O
felt  O
that  O
the  O
Asian  O
Zing  O
and  O
Mango  O
Habanero  O
was  O
quite  O
similar  O
with  O
a  O

has  O

.  O

We  O
had  O
the  O
Vurry  O
Curry  O
and  O
Italian  O
Herb  O
.  O

The  O
latter  O
has  O
a  O
very  O
nice  O
aroma  O
which  O
we  O
can  O
detect  O
from  O
a  O
distance  O
that  O
smelled  O
like  O
the  O
familiar  O
Taiwan  O
deep  O
fried  O
chicken  O
steak  O
(  O
)  O
.  O

While  O
the  O
sauces  O
were  O
painstakingly  O
homemade  O
from  O
scratch  O
using  O
over  O
75  O
different  O
spices  O
,  O
herbs  O
and  O
ingredients  O
,  O
the  O
lovely  O
seasonings  O
were  O
let  O
down  O
by  O
the  O
skinny  O
deep  O
fried  O
chicken  O
wings  O
that  O
probably  O
has  O
been  O
put  O
through  O
a  O
strict  O
diet  O
.  O

In  O
terms  O
of  O
flavours  O
,  O
the  O
eatery  O
is  O
on  O
the  O
right  O
track  O
but  O
they  O
probably  O
need  O
to  O
consider  O
using  O
more  O
succulent  O
chicken  O
wings  O
to  O
win  O
over  O
the  O
patron  O
's  O
palate  O
.  O

Will  O
this  O
specialty  O
chicken  O
wings  O
concept  O
be  O
a  O
success  O
?  O

can  O

In  O
my  O
previous  O
visit  O
to  O
Hummerstons  O
I  O
mentioned  O
that  O
I  O
used  O
the  O
Entertainer  O
App  O
to  O
redeem  O
one  O
for  O
one  O
main  O
.  O

When  O
I  O
used  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Entertainer  O
App  O
/bbbbbb  O
the  O
other  O
day  O
,  O
I  O
realised  O
there  O
was  O
a  O
quite  O
an  O
interesting  O
list  O
of  O
restaurants  O
that  O
I  O
want  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
.  O

After  O
browsing  O
through  O
the  O
list  O
,  O
I  O
decided  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
bbbbbb  O
The  O
Disgruntled  O
Chef  O
/bbbbbb  O
at  O
Dempsey  O
for  O
dinner  O
.  O

Launching  O
the  O
app  O
,  O
I  O
made  O
a  O
call  O
to  O
the  O
restaurant  O
to  O
make  O
a  O
reservation  O
.  O

Similar  O
to  O
my  O
previous  O
experience  O
in  O
using  O
the  O
Entertainer  O
App  O
,  O
the  O
waitress  O
was  O
well  O
aware  O
of  O
the  O
Entertainer  O
App  O
and  O
the  O
process  O
when  O
I  O
checked  O
with  O
her  O
.  O

All  O
I  O
have  O
to  O
do  O
is  O
during  O
payment  O
,  O
I  O
just  O
let  O
the  O
waitress  O
know  O
that  O
I  O
am  O
using  O
The  O
Entertainer  O
App  O
to  O
redeem  O
my  O
free  O
main  O
course  O
by  O
tapping  O
on  O
the  O
Redeem  O
Button  O
which  O
I  O
then  O
proceeded  O
to  O
enter  O
my  O
4  O
digit  O
pin  O
.  O

Passed  O
the  O
phone  O
to  O
the  O
waiter  O
for  O
the  O
restaurant  O
to  O
enter  O
their  O
own  O
private  O
pin  O
.  O

That  O
is  O
how  O
easy  O
to  O
use  O
the  O
The  O
Entertainer  O
App  O
.  O

Back  O
to  O
my  O
dinner  O
,  O
I  O
started  O
with  O
a  O
bbbbbb  O
Somersby  O
Apple  O
Cider  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
14  O
)  O
after  O
a  O
long  O
day  O
at  O
work  O
.  O

The  O
Disgruntled  O
Chef  O
also  O
offers  O
a  O
good  O
selection  O
of  O
wines  O
and  O
cocktails  O
if  O
you  O
just  O
want  O
to  O
chill  O
out  O
.  O

Steam  O

We  O
started  O
the  O
dinner  O
with  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Steam  O
Mussels  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
21  O
)  O
that  O
is  O
cooked  O
in  O
mergeus  O
and  O
white  O
wine  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
we  O
felt  O
that  O
the  O
mussels  O
were  O
not  O
very  O
fresh  O
,  O
it  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
tad  O
of  O
fishy  O
taste  O
.  O

Roasted  O

Scallops  O
3.8/5  O

Next  O
we  O
have  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O

)  O
with  O
truffle  O
butter  O
,  O
green  O

puree  O
and  O
crispy  O
prosciutto  O
.  O

While  O
the  O
scallops  O
was  O
beautifully  O
cooked  O
,  O
I  O
thought  O
the  O
green  O
pea  O
puree  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
coarse  O
.  O

Braised  O
Pork  O
Cheeks  O
4/5  O

As  O
this  O
was  O
our  O
first  O
time  O
at  O
The  O
Disgruntled  O
Chef  O
,  O
the  O
waitress  O
gave  O
us  O
a  O
brief  O
introduction  O
of  O
the  O
menu  O
and  O
recommended  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Braised  O
Pork  O
Cheeks  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
32  O
)  O
which  O
is  O
one  O
of  O
their  O
signature  O
dishes  O
.  O

The  O
braised  O
pork  O
cheeks  O
were  O
so  O
tender  O
that  O
it  O
basically  O
fell  O
apart  O
with  O
a  O
slight  O
cut  O
.  O

Served  O
with  O
truffle  O
mousseline  O
and  O
miso  O
daikon  O
,  O
this  O
is  O
indeed  O
an  O
enjoyable  O
dish  O
.  O

bbbbbb  O
Smoked  O

/bbbbbb  O
(  O

was  O
cooked  O
to  O
medium  O
as  O
per  O
what  O
I  O
requested  O
.  O

Served  O
with  O
a  O
port  O
wine  O
sauce  O
at  O
the  O
side  O
,  O
the  O
smokey  O
slab  O
of  O
beef  O
was  O
so  O
tender  O
and  O
juicy  O
on  O
its  O
own  O
that  O
I  O
neglected  O
the  O
sauce  O
.  O

I  O
probably  O
order  O
this  O
for  O
sharing  O
in  O
future  O
as  O
I  O
struggled  O
to  O
finish  O
the  O
whole  O
piece  O
of  O
ribeye  O
.  O

Walking  O
down  O
a  O
flight  O
of  O
stairs  O
leading  O
to  O
the  O
restaurant  O
,  O
it  O
felt  O
like  O
one  O
has  O
been  O
transformed  O
to  O
another  O
place  O
.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
is  O
actually  O
facing  O
the  O

the  O

giving  O
in  O
a  O
nice  O
private  O
ambience  O
away  O
from  O
the  O
crowd  O
and  O
noise  O
.  O

With  O
a  O
causal  O
dining  O
setting  O
and  O
concept  O
,  O
patron  O
can  O
simply  O
sit  O
back  O
,  O
enjoy  O
,  O
eat  O
and  O
drink  O
in  O
a  O
relaxing  O

I  O

it  O

probably  O
only  O
during  O

On  O
each  O
table  O
there  O
is  O
a  O
bottle  O
of  O
their  O
homemade  O

supposes  O
to  O
further  O
elevate  O
the  O
taste  O

richness  O
of  O
the  O
beef  O
.  O

I  O
did  O
not  O
like  O
it  O
,  O
it  O
tasted  O
like  O
fermented  O
bean  O
paste  O
and  O
was  O
quite  O

we  O
tried  O
the  O

Kazan  O
Kaisen  O
Shio  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
15/  O
$  O
18  O
)  O
.  O

Kazan  O
ramen  O
uses  O
broader  O
noodle  O
so  O
that  O
it  O
does  O
not  O
get  O
soggy  O
easily  O
.  O

Even  O
thought  O
the  O
broader  O
noodle  O
is  O
used  O
,  O
it  O
still  O
got  O
soggy  O
pretty  O
quickly  O
.  O

My  O
advice  O
is  O
to  O
either  O
finish  O
the  O
ramen  O
as  O
fast  O
as  O
possible  O
or  O
transferred  O
all  O
to  O
the  O
smaller  O
bowl  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
because  O
the  O
hot  O
stone  O
is  O
still  O
continuing  O
cooking  O
the  O
bowl  O
of  O
ramen  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
noticed  O
that  O
kazan  O
ramen  O
uses  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
vegetables  O
like  O
bean  O
sprouts  O

If  O
you  O
prefer  O

the  O
bbbbbb  O
Kazan  O

/bbbbbb  O
(  O

is  O
enhanced  O
with  O
a  O
special  O
blend  O
of  O
spicy  O

While  O
my  O

preferred  O
it  O
to  O
be  O
spicier  O
I  O
am  O
acceptable  O
to  O
the  O

The  O
homemade  O

definitely  O
was  O
the  O
star  O
elevating  O
the  O
flavours  O
.  O

with  O

The  O

comes  O
with  O

red  O

,  O
mochi  O
and  O
ice  O
cream  O
similar  O
to  O
our  O
local  O

I  O
loved  O
the  O
fact  O
the  O
exterior  O
of  O
the  O
shaved  O
ice  O
is  O
drenched  O
with  O
condensed  O
milk  O
which  O
I  O
could  O
not  O
help  O
going  O
back  O
for  O
more  O
.  O

However  O
the  O
macha  O
syrup  O
was  O
too  O
sweet  O
and  O
lacklustre  O
in  O
the  O
green  O
tea  O
flavour  O
.  O

I  O
ca  O
n't  O
say  O
Tonkotsu  O
Kazan  O
is  O
the  O
best  O
ramen  O
in  O
town  O
but  O
they  O
sure  O
have  O
their  O
own  O
unique  O
volcano  O

selling  O
point  O
as  O
well  O
as  O
their  O
huge  O

which  O
is  O
value  O
for  O
money  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
like  O
the  O
face  O
that  O
their  O
tonkotsu  O
broth  O
does  O
not  O
give  O
me  O
a  O
greasy  O
aftertaste  O

Yesterday  O
while  O

where  O
to  O
go  O
for  O

after  O

with  O
my  O

I  O
browsed  O
through  O

decided  O
to  O
go  O
to  O

for  O

as  O
it  O

from  O
where  O
I  O
was  O
by  O
simply  O
checking  O
the  O
map  O

of  O
the  O
app  O
and  O
made  O
a  O
call  O
to  O
make  O
sure  O
it  O
is  O
not  O
full  O
.  O

As  O
this  O
is  O
a  O
new  O
app  O
,  O
I  O
thought  O
I  O
better  O
be  O
safe  O
so  O
I  O
checked  O
with  O
the  O
waiter  O
that  O
they  O
are  O
aware  O
of  O
The  O
Entertainer  O
App  O
and  O
I  O
could  O
use  O
it  O
to  O
bbbbbb  O

a  O
One  O
for  O
One  O
Main  O
/bbbbbb  O
which  O
is  O
offered  O

I  O
was  O
glad  O
that  O
the  O
waiter  O
is  O
well  O
aware  O
of  O
the  O
app  O
and  O
proceed  O
to  O
explain  O
how  O
easy  O
to  O
use  O
it  O
.  O

During  O
payment  O
,  O
I  O
just  O
let  O
the  O
waiter  O
know  O
that  O
I  O
am  O
using  O
The  O
Entertainer  O
App  O
to  O
redeem  O
my  O
free  O
main  O
course  O
by  O
tapping  O
on  O
the  O
Redeem  O
Button  O
which  O
I  O
proceeded  O
to  O
enter  O
my  O
4  O

.  O

Passed  O
the  O
phone  O
to  O
the  O

the  O

to  O

After  O
getting  O
the  O
assurance  O
from  O
the  O
waiter  O
,  O
we  O
proceeded  O
to  O
order  O
our  O
dinner  O
.  O

We  O
have  O
the  O

/bbbbbb  O
(  O

also  O
order  O

which  O
was  O
bbbbbb  O
French  O
Onion  O
Soup  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
to  O
have  O
a  O
variety  O
.  O

The  O
french  O

soup  O
was  O
tangy  O
with  O
a  O

from  O
the  O

Spanish  O
Pork  O
3/5  O

For  O
the  O
mains  O
,  O
we  O
tried  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Spanish  O
Pork  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
where  O
the  O
spanish  O
duroc  O
pork  O
is  O
char  O
grilled  O
and  O
served  O
with  O
spinach  O
,  O
french  O
beans  O
,  O
spanish  O
onions  O
,  O
roasted  O
corn  O
and  O
red  O
skin  O
potatoes  O
with  O
tonkatsu  O
dressing  O
.  O

I  O
think  O
there  O
was  O
some  O
issue  O
with  O
the  O
plating  O
because  O
the  O
tonkatsu  O
dressing  O
was  O
totally  O
being  O
absorbed  O
by  O
the  O
greens  O
making  O
it  O
way  O
too  O
sweet  O
to  O
be  O
eaten  O
.  O

While  O
on  O
the  O
other  O
hand  O
,  O
the  O
pork  O
was  O
screaming  O
for  O
a  O
dressing  O
for  O
the  O

perfectly  O
cooked  O

They  O
must  O
be  O

usually  O
very  O
bitter  O

I  O
after  O

I  O
heard  O
about  O
this  O
cool  O

marriage  O
the  O
old  O
abandoned  O
Chinese  O
Medical  O

The  O

still  O
have  O
the  O
name  O

the  O
old  O

The  O
centerpiece  O
of  O
the  O
cafe  O
is  O
the  O
Chinese  O
Medicine  O
Cabinets  O
behind  O

These  O
Chinese  O
medicine  O
cabinets  O
used  O
to  O
hold  O
many  O
potent  O
remedies  O
to  O
cure  O
the  O
residents  O
'  O
ailments  O
.  O

The  O
antique  O
gave  O
the  O
modern  O
cafe  O
a  O
historical  O
charm  O
.  O

Coffee  O
cup  O
sleeves  O
can  O
also  O
be  O
seen  O
sticking  O
around  O
the  O

A  O

entrance  O

the  O
Chinese  O
Medicine  O
Cabinet  O
is  O
located  O
leading  O
the  O
way  O
to  O
the  O
seating  O
around  O
at  O
the  O
back  O
of  O
the  O

Turning  O
left  O
there  O
is  O
a  O
staircase  O
leading  O
to  O
the  O
2nd  O
floor  O
of  O
the  O
cafe  O
.  O

A  O
corner  O
of  O
the  O

again  O
we  O
can  O
noticed  O

I  O
like  O

as  O

.  O

My  O
only  O
complain  O
is  O
that  O
the  O
cafe  O
latte  O
is  O
served  O
in  O
paper  O

even  O
thought  O
I  O

I  O

can  O
rejuvenate  O
over  O

I  O

The  O

that  O
I  O
just  O
need  O
to  O
get  O

Unlike  O

,  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Mediterranean  O

with  O

this  O
was  O
quite  O
an  O

dish  O
.  O

Although  O
the  O
pasta  O
skin  O
is  O
a  O
bit  O
thicker  O
,  O
I  O
enjoyed  O
that  O
bite  O
to  O
it  O
especially  O
when  O
they  O
are  O
freshly  O
made  O

instead  O
of  O

I  O

preferred  O
this  O
over  O

I  O
thought  O
the  O
soft  O
and  O
fluffy  O
brioche  O
works  O
better  O
with  O
the  O
dish  O
compared  O
to  O
puff  O

Paired  O
with  O
the  O
perigord  O
sauce  O
which  O
is  O
basically  O
a  O
truffle  O
and  O
wine  O
sauce  O
,  O
it  O
simply  O
accentuated  O
the  O
flavour  O
of  O
the  O
beef  O
tenderloin  O
.  O

The  O
dish  O
has  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
strong  O
and  O
bold  O
flavours  O
in  O
it  O
and  O
can  O
be  O
a  O
bit  O
heavy  O
if  O
you  O
are  O
not  O
a  O
big  O
eater  O

I  O
think  O
most  O
people  O
like  O
me  O
if  O
given  O
a  O
choice  O
will  O
not  O
visit  O
any  O
vegetarian  O
restaurants  O
.  O

There  O
is  O
just  O
this  O
unsatisfactory  O
feelingof  O
not  O
being  O
full  O
when  O
one  O
does  O
not  O
consume  O
meat  O
for  O
a  O
meal  O
.  O

However  O
it  O
does  O
not  O
mean  O
that  O
vegetarian  O
food  O
is  O
not  O
delicious  O
and  O
Ihave  O
been  O
introduced  O
to  O
probably  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
bestvegetarian  O

I  O
was  O
overwhelmed  O
by  O
the  O
huge  O
menu  O
at  O

that  O
includes  O
North  O
Indian  O
,  O
South  O
Indian  O
and  O
Asian  O
fusion  O
vegetarian  O
cuisine  O
.  O

According  O
to  O
Luke  O
,  O
there  O
are  O
over  O
500  O
over  O
items  O
in  O
the  O
menu  O
.  O

That  O
is  O
a  O
menu  O
that  O
is  O
not  O
easy  O
for  O
any  O
ordinary  O
kitchen  O
to  O
pull  O
it  O
off  O

We  O
started  O
with  O

of  O

$  O
10  O
)  O
.  O

Love  O
that  O
the  O
restaurant  O
used  O
basmatic  O
rice  O
for  O
their  O
briyani  O
.  O

The  O
long  O
grain  O
rice  O
was  O
fragrant  O
and  O
fluffy  O
.  O

Hidden  O
in  O
the  O
pile  O
of  O
rice  O
was  O
the  O
delectable  O
masala  O
soya  O
chunks  O
.  O

Mysore  O
Mutton  O
4.5/5  O

The  O
Mysore  O
Mutton  O
(  O
$  O
9  O
)  O
was  O
my  O
favourite  O
for  O
the  O
night  O
.  O

The  O
vegetarian  O
mutton  O
was  O
cooked  O
in  O
mysore  O
gravy  O
that  O
was  O
so  O
delish  O
with  O
all  O
the  O
different  O
delectable  O
spices  O
hitting  O
the  O
palate  O
.  O

Even  O
the  O
texture  O
of  O
the  O
vegetarian  O
mutton  O
was  O
so  O
close  O
to  O
the  O
real  O
thing  O
that  O
I  O
could  O
be  O
easily  O
fooled  O
if  O
in  O
a  O
blind  O
tasting  O
.  O

We  O
also  O
got  O
the  O
romali  O
roti  O
to  O
go  O
with  O
the  O
mysore  O
mutton  O
.  O

Malai  O
Kofta  O
4.2/5  O

I  O
called  O
it  O
the  O
twin  O
tower  O
when  O
the  O
Malai  O
Kofta  O
(  O
$  O
10  O
)  O
was  O
served  O
.  O

It  O
definitely  O
is  O
a  O
eye  O
catching  O
dish  O
.  O

The  O
kofta  O
cooked  O
in  O
Mughlai  O
style  O
has  O
a  O
smooth  O
and  O
creamy  O
gravy  O
drench  O
over  O
the  O
towering  O
kofta  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
not  O
exactly  O
sure  O
what  O
is  O
in  O
it  O
but  O
I  O
could  O
taste  O
potato  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
my  O
first  O
encounter  O
of  O
the  O
dish  O
and  O
I  O
totally  O
enjoyed  O
it  O
.  O

Kind  O
of  O
having  O
a  O
potato  O
salad  O
in  O
a  O
creamy  O
sauce  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
to  O
say  O
I  O
had  O
a  O
satisfying  O
dinner  O
at  O
Gokul  O
.  O

I  O
left  O
not  O
feeling  O
that  O
I  O
have  O
actually  O
eaten  O
vegetarian  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
never  O
expected  O
vegetarian  O
dish  O
can  O
be  O
so  O
tasty  O
and  O
I  O
applauded  O
their  O
vegetarian  O
rendition  O
of  O
Asian  O
cuisine  O
.  O

There  O
are  O
so  O
many  O
items  O
on  O
their  O
menu  O
that  O
I  O
want  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
and  O
I  O
am  O
sure  O
they  O
will  O
be  O
as  O
good  O
as  O
what  O
I  O
had  O
.  O

A  O
common  O
hawker  O
fare  O
at  O
many  O
hawker  O
centres  O
and  O
food  O
courts  O
is  O
the  O
carrot  O
cake  O
but  O
not  O
many  O
can  O
do  O
it  O
well  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
read  O
many  O
reviews  O
that  O
Fu  O
Ming  O
Cooked  O
Food  O
at  O
Redhill  O
Food  O
Centre  O
wok  O
up  O
some  O
pretty  O
awesome  O
carrot  O
cake  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
glad  O
that  O
I  O
am  O
able  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O
stall  O
since  O
I  O
was  O
in  O
the  O

Black  O
Carrot  O
Cake  O
4.2/5  O

At  O
Fu  O
Ming  O
Cooked  O
Food  O
,  O
the  O
stall  O
cooks  O
both  O
the  O
white  O
and  O
black  O
version  O
.  O

I  O
tried  O
the  O
Black  O
Carrot  O
Cake  O
(  O
$  O
3  O
)  O
which  O
definitely  O
live  O
up  O
to  O
the  O
numerous  O
good  O
reviews  O
they  O
have  O
received  O
.  O

Unlike  O
most  O
stalls  O
that  O
took  O
their  O
carrot  O
cake  O
from  O
mass  O
production  O
factory  O
nowadays  O
,  O
this  O
humble  O
little  O
stall  O
at  O
redhill  O
food  O
centre  O
still  O
steamed  O
their  O
own  O
carrot  O
cake  O
.  O

Black  O
Carrot  O
Cake  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
plate  O
of  O
black  O
carrot  O
cake  O
came  O
with  O
different  O
sizes  O
that  O
were  O
evenly  O
coated  O
with  O
the  O
dark  O
sweet  O
sauce  O
.  O

The  O
texture  O
of  O
the  O
carrot  O
cake  O
was  O
the  O
softer  O
type  O
while  O
the  O
smaller  O
pieces  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
crispy  O
char  O
to  O
it  O
.  O

The  O
dark  O
sweet  O
sauce  O
was  O
added  O
to  O
the  O
cooking  O
twice  O
.  O

Once  O
in  O
the  O
mid  O
of  O
frying  O
and  O
right  O
at  O
the  O
end  O
.  O

Maybe  O
that  O
is  O
the  O
secret  O
to  O
this  O
delish  O
dark  O
carrot  O
cake  O
.  O

Overall  O
I  O
agreed  O
with  O
most  O
reviews  O
that  O
Fu  O

Cooked  O
Food  O
's  O
carrot  O
cake  O
is  O
probably  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
best  O
in  O

The  O
homemade  O
carrot  O

not  O

that  O

Competition  O
is  O
heating  O
up  O
in  O
Tampines  O
Street  O
81  O
with  O
the  O
opening  O
of  O
another  O
neighbourhood  O
Thai  O
eatery  O
,  O
Bangrak  O
Thai  O
Kitchen  O
just  O
two  O
doors  O
away  O
from  O
Soi  O
Thai  O
Kitchen  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
a  O
rainy  O
afternoon  O
and  O
perfect  O
for  O
some  O
Thai  O
food.I  O
was  O
there  O
with  O
Maureen  O
and  O
Leroy  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O
2  O
months  O
old  O
restaurant  O
.  O

Thai  O
Prawn  O
Cake  O
3/5  O

Lunch  O
started  O
with  O
the  O
Thai  O
Prawn  O
Cake  O
(  O
$  O
6.90  O
)  O
which  O
was  O
deep  O
fried  O
to  O
a  O
nice  O
golden  O
brown  O
.  O

The  O
crust  O
was  O
crispy  O
and  O
not  O
oily  O
.  O

However  O
the  O
filling  O
was  O
lacking  O
that  O
prawny  O
satisfaction  O
that  O
one  O
seek  O
out  O
in  O
a  O
good  O
prawn  O
cake  O
.  O

Pandan  O
Leaf  O
Chicken  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
other  O
appertizer  O
in  O
the  O
menu  O
we  O
tried  O
is  O
the  O
Pandan  O
Leaf  O
Chicken  O
(  O
$  O
5.90/2pc  O
)  O
.  O

This  O
fairmuch  O
better  O
than  O
the  O
Thai  O
prawn  O
cake  O
.  O

The  O
aroma  O
of  O
the  O
pandan  O
leaf  O
can  O
be  O
detected  O
from  O
a  O
distance  O
and  O
infused  O
to  O
the  O
chicken  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O
was  O
also  O
tender  O
and  O
moist  O
.  O

Stir  O
Fried  O
Chilli  O
Basil  O
with  O
Chicken  O
3.5/5  O

The  O
owner  O
told  O
us  O
that  O
their  O
Stir  O
Fried  O
Chilli  O
Basil  O
withChicken  O
(  O
$  O
5.90  O
)  O
was  O
cooked  O
to  O
order  O
unlike  O
other  O
restaurantsthatprepared  O
in  O
batch  O
.  O

Flavours  O
were  O
spot  O
on  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
lacking  O
that  O
unique  O
fragrant  O
basil  O
aroma  O
.  O

Stir  O
Fried  O
Squid  O
with  O
Salted  O
Egg  O
Yolk  O
4.2/5  O

It  O
just  O
seems  O
like  O
salted  O
egg  O
yolk  O
can  O
be  O
incorporated  O
in  O
almost  O
any  O
dishes  O
.  O

Bangrok  O
created  O
the  O
Stir  O
Fried  O
Squid  O
with  O
Salted  O
Egg  O
Squid  O
(  O
$  O
16  O
)  O
which  O
is  O
one  O
of  O
their  O
popular  O
dishes  O
.  O

I  O
can  O
understand  O
why  O
so  O
,  O
with  O
the  O
salted  O
egg  O
working  O
magically  O
well  O
with  O
the  O
fresh  O
and  O
crunchy  O
squid  O
.  O

Steamed  O
Fish  O
with  O
Spicy  O
Lime  O
Sauce  O
4/5  O

Another  O
popular  O
item  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
is  O
the  O
Steamed  O
Fish  O
with  O
Spicy  O
Lime  O
Sauce  O
(  O
$  O
22  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
fresh  O
and  O
moist  O
fish  O
definitely  O
will  O
be  O
well  O
received  O
with  O
their  O
spiciness  O
and  O
sourness  O
.  O

However  O
,  O
Ifelted  O
the  O
flavours  O
can  O
be  O
more  O
heavy  O
handed  O
.  O

Red  O
Curry  O
Prawn  O
3/5  O

The  O
Red  O
Curry  O
Prawn  O
(  O
$  O
11.90  O
)  O
was  O
a  O
love  O
and  O
hate  O
affair  O
.  O

I  O
loved  O
the  O
sweet  O
creamy  O
gravy  O
that  O
goes  O
well  O
with  O
a  O
plate  O
of  O
rice  O
.  O

However  O
the  O
prawn  O
was  O
lacking  O
in  O
sweetness  O
even  O
though  O
the  O
restaurant  O
claims  O
that  O
they  O
used  O
live  O
prawns  O
.  O

Clear  O
Tom  O
Yam  O
Soup  O
with  O
Seafood  O
3.5/5  O

The  O
Clear  O
Tom  O
Yam  O
Soup  O
with  O
Seafood  O
(  O
$  O
7.90  O
)  O
was  O
perfect  O
for  O
the  O
rainy  O
day  O
.  O

Like  O
most  O
of  O
the  O
dishes  O
,  O
I  O
cantaste  O
that  O
fiery  O
level  O
of  O
the  O
dishes  O
have  O
all  O
beentoned  O
downto  O
suit  O
majority  O
of  O
the  O
patrons  O
.  O

I  O
personally  O
prefer  O
it  O
to  O
be  O
more  O
spicy  O
or  O
else  O
that  O
will  O
lose  O
the  O
characteristic  O
of  O
Thai  O
cuisine  O
.  O

Stir  O
Fried  O
Kang  O
Kong  O
Thai  O
Style  O
3.8/5  O

The  O
Stir  O
Fried  O
Kang  O
Kong  O
Thai  O
Style  O
(  O
$  O
5.90  O
)  O
was  O
cooked  O
to  O
a  O
nice  O
crunchy  O
bite  O
but  O
not  O
overly  O
spicy  O
.  O

Phad  O
Thai  O
4/5  O

The  O
Phad  O
Thai  O
(  O
$  O
5.90  O
)  O
was  O
actually  O
pretty  O
delectable  O
.  O

It  O
's  O
probably  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
better  O
one  O
that  O
I  O
have  O
eaten  O
.  O

Tapioca  O
with  O
Coconut  O
Cream  O
4.2/5  O

Our  O
lunch  O
ended  O
with  O
some  O
Tapioca  O
with  O
Coconut  O
Cream  O
(  O
$  O
7.90  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
tapioca  O
was  O
pretty  O
fork  O
tender  O
.  O

Paired  O
with  O
the  O
coconut  O
cream  O
which  O
I  O
suspected  O
honey  O
was  O
also  O
added  O
gave  O
it  O
a  O
nice  O
sweet  O
finishing  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
good  O
to  O
see  O
another  O
Thai  O
eatery  O
opening  O
in  O
the  O
neighbourhood  O
offering  O
affordable  O
Thai  O
cuisine  O
.  O

My  O
first  O
impression  O
of  O
Bangrok  O
Thai  O
Kitchen  O
is  O
that  O
the  O
pricing  O
is  O
wallet  O
friendly  O
.  O

While  O
the  O
food  O
is  O
good  O
but  O
I  O
think  O
it  O
has  O
lost  O
the  O
characteristic  O
of  O
authentic  O
Thai  O
cuisine  O
when  O
seasoning  O
is  O
being  O
toned  O
down  O
too  O
much  O

or  O
East  O
meets  O
West  O
cuisine  O
but  O
it  O
usually  O
went  O
horribly  O
wrong  O
or  O
simply  O
by  O
adding  O
a  O
few  O
minor  O
touches  O
of  O
Asian  O
ingredients  O
to  O
the  O
dish  O
.  O

At  O
Pidgin  O
,  O
I  O
can  O
totally  O
appreciate  O
the  O
meaning  O
of  O
fusion  O
or  O
East  O
meets  O
West  O
.  O

In  O
a  O
way  O
bringing  O
it  O
to  O
a  O
whole  O
new  O
level  O
.  O

They  O
have  O
simply  O
deconstructed  O
the  O
whole  O
meaning  O
of  O
fusion  O
and  O
conceptualized  O
an  O
unique  O
and  O
out  O
of  O
this  O
world  O
dish  O
but  O
not  O
losing  O
the  O
association  O
with  O
the  O
Southeast  O
Asian  O
cuisine  O

It  O
has  O
been  O
a  O
while  O
since  O
I  O
last  O
visted  O
Joo  O

and  O
I  O
was  O
glad  O
that  O
I  O
was  O
back  O
to  O
this  O
lovely  O
enclave  O
of  O
cultural  O
heritage  O
as  O
well  O
as  O
many  O
eateries  O
and  O
restaurants  O
in  O
the  O
area  O
.  O

Walking  O
down  O
the  O
rows  O
of  O
shop  O
houses  O
along  O
Joo  O
Chiat  O
Road  O
,  O
I  O
noticed  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
new  O
establishments  O
in  O
the  O
area  O
.  O

One  O
such  O
new  O

The  O
bbbbbb  O
Bak  O
Kut  O
Teh  O
/bbbbbb  O
here  O
is  O
the  O
Teochew  O
version  O
in  O
which  O
the  O
soup  O
base  O
is  O
clear  O
and  O
peppery  O
.  O

The  O
bbbbbb  O
Pork  O
Ribs  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
5.50  O
)  O
came  O
in  O
a  O
bowl  O
of  O
4  O
.  O

The  O
pork  O
ribs  O
was  O
nicely  O
cooked  O
to  O
a  O
nice  O
tender  O
that  O
fell  O
off  O
the  O
bone  O
with  O
ease  O
.  O

While  O
I  O
could  O
taste  O
the  O
garlic  O
in  O
the  O
clear  O
soup  O
base  O
,  O
I  O
thought  O
it  O
was  O
lacking  O
in  O
the  O
peppery  O
aroma  O
of  O
a  O
typical  O
Teochew  O

prefer  O

the  O

Prime  O
Ribs  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
8.50  O
)  O
comes  O
in  O
a  O
pair  O
.  O

Like  O
the  O
previous  O
bowl  O
of  O
pork  O
ribs  O
,  O
the  O
soup  O
was  O
lacking  O
the  O
peppery  O
aroma  O
.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
explained  O
that  O
they  O
have  O
toned  O
down  O
the  O
pepper  O
level  O
after  O
receiving  O
feedback  O
to  O
cater  O
to  O
the  O
majority  O
of  O
the  O
diners  O
.  O

While  O
it  O
is  O
good  O
to  O
listen  O
to  O
feedback  O
but  O
I  O
thought  O
it  O
lost  O
the  O
character  O
of  O
a  O
typical  O
bowl  O
of  O
Teochew  O
bak  O
kut  O
teh  O
.  O

After  O
tasting  O
the  O
2  O
bowls  O
of  O
bak  O
kut  O
teh  O
,  O
my  O
preference  O
went  O
to  O
the  O
pork  O
ribs  O
.  O

I  O
felt  O
that  O
the  O
prime  O
ribs  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
tough  O
and  O
dry  O
compared  O
to  O
the  O
pork  O
ribs  O
.  O

With  O
all  O
the  O
meat  O
on  O
the  O
table  O
,  O
the  O
plate  O
of  O
greens  O
was  O
definitely  O
a  O
welcome  O
sight  O
to  O
add  O
some  O
balance  O
to  O
the  O
diet  O
.  O

Pig  O

4.2/5  O

It  O
is  O
quite  O
common  O
to  O
have  O
bbbbbb  O
Pig  O
Trotter  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O

)  O
selling  O
along  O
side  O
the  O
bak  O
kut  O
teh  O
in  O
most  O
stalls  O
.  O

The  O
pig  O
trotter  O
was  O
slow  O
braised  O
beautifully  O
absorbing  O
all  O
the  O
marinade  O
.  O

The  O
best  O
part  O
is  O
the  O
collagen  O
loaded  O
skin  O
that  O
basically  O
melted  O
in  O
the  O
mouth  O
.  O

Pork  O
Belly  O
4/5  O

The  O
next  O
2  O
dishes  O
are  O
a  O
bit  O
interesting  O
which  O
are  O
not  O
commonly  O
served  O
in  O
a  O
bak  O
kut  O
teh  O
restaurant  O
but  O
rather  O
at  O
Teochew  O
porridge  O
restaurant  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
I  O
am  O
sure  O
patrons  O
do  O
not  O
mind  O
the  O
varieties  O
available  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
,  O
the  O
more  O
the  O
better  O
.  O

The  O
bbbbbb  O

/bbbbbb  O
(  O

was  O
once  O
again  O
nicely  O
braised  O
and  O
packed  O
with  O
all  O
the  O
lovely  O
flavours  O
.  O

I  O
could  O
not  O
help  O
comparing  O
the  O
dishes  O
like  O
a  O
game  O
of  O
chess  O
.  O

The  O

won  O
my  O
palate  O
over  O
the  O
white  O

After  O
a  O
good  O
4  O
months  O
plus  O
wait  O
I  O
finally  O
stepped  O
into  O
bbbbbb  O
Teppei  O
at  O

/bbbbbb  O
which  O
is  O
famed  O
for  O
its  O

I  O
called  O
to  O
make  O
a  O
reservation  O
back  O
in  O
May  O
2013  O
and  O
I  O
was  O
told  O
they  O
only  O
have  O
seats  O
for  O
me  O
in  O
mid  O
October  O
2013  O
.  O

Stepping  O
into  O
the  O
21  O
counter  O
seats  O
only  O
restaurant  O
,  O
the  O
place  O
is  O
really  O
quite  O
small  O
with  O
hardly  O
any  O
walking  O
space  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
quite  O
amazing  O
how  O
the  O
chefs  O
and  O
servers  O
work  O
in  O
the  O
tiny  O
space  O
with  O
our  O
eyes  O
glued  O
to  O
their  O
preparation  O
of  O
our  O
food  O
.  O

After  O
settling  O
down  O
.  O

we  O
were  O
quickly  O
served  O
a  O
number  O
of  O
starters  O
in  O
sequence  O
to  O
whet  O
up  O
our  O
appetite  O
.  O

We  O
had  O
a  O
refreshing  O
bbbbbb  O
salad  O
/bbbbbb  O
,  O
bbbbbb  O
beancurd  O
skin  O
/bbbbbb  O
,  O
bbbbbb  O

and  O
grilled  O
bbbbbb  O
edamame  O

.  O

I  O
was  O
looking  O
forward  O
to  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Sashimi  O

/bbbbbb  O
.  O

The  O
sashimi  O
was  O
fresh  O
and  O
melted  O
in  O
the  O
mouth  O
.  O

Of  O
course  O
I  O
can  O
not  O
compare  O
the  O
quality  O
to  O
what  O
I  O
had  O
at  O
Tsukiji  O
Market  O
Tokyo  O
earlier  O
this  O
year  O
.  O

For  O
that  O
moment  O
it  O
strikes  O
me  O
that  O
most  O
Japan  O
restaurant  O
in  O
Singapore  O
does  O
not  O
slice  O
the  O
fish  O
as  O
big  O
as  O
it  O
is  O
in  O
Japan  O
,  O
could  O
it  O
be  O
part  O
of  O
the  O
cost  O
saving  O
to  O
recover  O
the  O
cost  O
of  O
air  O
flown  O
ingredients  O
?  O

bbbbbb  O
Sushi  O

/bbbbbb  O
has  O
everyone  O
raving  O
about  O
the  O

Teppei  O
has  O
added  O
crispy  O
bits  O
of  O
fried  O
tempura  O
batter  O
(  O
tenkasu  O
)  O
giving  O
the  O
sushi  O
roll  O
a  O
whole  O
new  O
dimension  O
of  O
enjoyment  O
.  O

I  O
could  O
not  O
remember  O
what  O
type  O
of  O
fish  O
was  O
used  O
in  O
this  O
dish  O
.  O

The  O
fish  O
was  O
quite  O
meaty  O
in  O
a  O
light  O
refreshing  O
broth  O
.  O

If  O
I  O
remembered  O
correct  O
,  O
this  O
was  O
bbbbbb  O
Sweet  O
Potato  O
Chawanmushi  O
/bbbbbb  O
.  O

The  O
bottom  O
was  O
sweet  O
potato  O
with  O
the  O
egg  O
custard  O
sitting  O
on  O
top  O
.  O

I  O
felt  O
this  O
was  O
the  O
weakness  O
link  O
of  O
the  O
night  O
which  O
tasted  O
quite  O
bland  O
.  O

The  O
bbbbbb  O
Oyster  O
/bbbbbb  O
was  O
simply  O
heavenly  O
.  O

Nothing  O
fancy  O
allowing  O
one  O
to  O
enjoy  O
the  O
natural  O
flavour  O
of  O
the  O

.  O

The  O
sweetness  O
of  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Scallop  O
and  O
Uni  O
/bbbbbb  O
combination  O
was  O
like  O
marriage  O
made  O
in  O
heaven  O
.  O

The  O
bursting  O
of  O
flavours  O
in  O
the  O
mouth  O
and  O
long  O
lasting  O
lingering  O
aftertaste  O
was  O
probably  O
what  O
most  O
will  O
described  O
as  O
umami  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
quite  O
an  O
interesting  O
dish  O
with  O
bold  O
flavours  O
and  O
textures  O
.  O

The  O
bbbbbb  O
Squid  O
/bbbbbb  O
was  O
actually  O
served  O
with  O
soft  O
bones  O
that  O
is  O
edible  O
giving  O
it  O
a  O
nice  O
crunchy  O
bite  O

that  O
was  O
crispy  O
on  O
the  O

and  O
moist  O
inside  O
.  O

First  O
time  O
having  O
the  O
whole  O
bbbbbb  O
Pufferfish  O
/bbbbbb  O
which  O
was  O
done  O
in  O
deep  O
fried  O
style  O
.  O

With  O
a  O
squeeze  O
of  O
the  O
zesty  O
lemon  O
,  O
it  O
enhanced  O
the  O
flavour  O
by  O
a  O
notch  O

Delight  O
in  O
sight  O
and  O
beautiful  O
in  O
taste  O
,  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Shabu  O
Chutoro  O
/bbbbbb  O
was  O
one  O
the  O
better  O
highlight  O
of  O
the  O
whole  O
omakase  O
experience  O
that  O
literally  O
melted  O
in  O
the  O
mouth  O
.  O

The  O
omakase  O
experience  O
also  O
came  O
with  O
bite  O
size  O
item  O
that  O
was  O
a  O
welcoming  O
break  O
for  O
the  O
whole  O
23  O

Some  O
of  O
the  O

we  O
had  O

the  O

For  O

it  O
will  O

I  O

to  O
go  O
for  O
the  O
Sanma  O
Sushi  O
even  O
thought  O
I  O
have  O
ordered  O
the  O
French  O
set  O
menu  O
.  O

Since  O
I  O
was  O
given  O
a  O
choice  O
and  O
the  O
restaurant  O
is  O
known  O
for  O
both  O
its  O
Japanese  O
and  O
French  O
fare  O
,  O
I  O
might  O
as  O
well  O
try  O
both  O
the  O
culinary  O
styles  O
.  O

The  O
Sanma  O

was  O
served  O
on  O
a  O
bed  O
of  O
raphanus  O
sauce  O
and  O
topped  O
with  O
yuzu  O
miso  O
.  O

The  O
execution  O
of  O
the  O
sanma  O

was  O
more  O
robust  O
compared  O
to  O
the  O
usual  O

since  O
I  O
already  O
had  O

It  O
was  O

with  O
the  O
beautifully  O
cooked  O

served  O
with  O

Picking  O

out  O
of  O
the  O

I  O
thought  O
the  O
sauce  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
on  O
the  O
salty  O
side  O
.  O

It  O
seemed  O
like  O
the  O

in  O
his  O

Conjunction  O

The  O

was  O
an  O
unique  O
and  O
interesting  O
change  O
from  O
the  O
tradition  O
.  O

It  O
had  O
textures  O
but  O
the  O
taste  O
may  O
be  O
too  O
refined  O
for  O
the  O
Asian  O
palate  O
that  O
is  O
used  O
to  O
the  O
traditional  O
taste  O

of  O
all  O

the  O

formerly  O

Oyster  O
fans  O
will  O
rejoice  O
with  O
the  O
different  O
offering  O
of  O
tempting  O
new  O
oyster  O
flavours  O
in  O
the  O
new  O
menu  O
.  O

Starting  O
from  O
left  O
to  O
right  O
,  O
we  O
have  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Mentaiyaki  O
Oyster  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
34  O
for  O
half  O
dozen  O
)  O
which  O
is  O
served  O
with  O
mentaiko  O
,  O
crunchy  O
ebiko  O
,  O
lemon  O
juice  O
and  O
aioli  O
.  O

Followed  O
by  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Kilpatrick  O
Oyster  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
34  O
for  O
half  O
dozen  O
)  O
which  O
is  O
topped  O
with  O
lardon  O
of  O
bacon  O
,  O
Worchestershire  O
and  O
chives  O
.  O

And  O
lastly  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Chilean  O
Oyster  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
34  O
for  O
half  O
dozen  O
)  O
comprised  O
a  O
refreshing  O
combination  O
of  O
serrano  O
,  O
lime  O
juice  O
,  O
red  O
wine  O
vinegar  O
and  O
cilantro  O
.  O

Each  O
oyster  O
has  O
its  O
own  O
characteristic  O
and  O
I  O
enjoyed  O
how  O
the  O
different  O
sauces  O
and  O
ingredients  O
accentuated  O
the  O
experience  O
.  O

The  O
Chilean  O
will  O
be  O
cleaner  O
in  O
flavour  O
allowing  O
one  O
to  O
appreciate  O
the  O
freshness  O
of  O
the  O
oyster  O
.  O

The  O
Kilpatrick  O
has  O
a  O
bolder  O
flavour  O
further  O
lifted  O
by  O
the  O
different  O
textures  O
.  O

The  O
Mentaiyaki  O
appealed  O
to  O
me  O
more  O
with  O
its  O
subtle  O
Japanese  O
influenced  O
flavours  O
.  O

got  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Duck  O
Confit  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
,  O
for  O
a  O
moment  O
it  O
reminded  O
me  O
of  O
ayam  O
penyet  O
because  O
of  O
how  O
flat  O
the  O
duck  O
has  O
been  O
flatten  O
.  O

Putting  O
the  O
presentation  O
aside  O
,  O
the  O
duck  O
confit  O
was  O
really  O
tender  O
and  O
fell  O
off  O
the  O
pork  O
with  O
ease  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
glad  O
that  O
the  O
curing  O
has  O
not  O
caused  O
the  O
duck  O
to  O
be  O
too  O
salty  O
with  O
the  O
orange  O
segments  O
and  O
orange  O
infused  O

a  O

presentation  O
of  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Pork  O
Belly  O
/bbbbbb  O

looked  O

on  O
a  O

The  O
main  O
itself  O
was  O
a  O

disappointing  O
.  O

The  O
pork  O
belly  O
still  O
has  O
a  O
hint  O
of  O
that  O

/bbbbbb  O
(  O

which  O

The  O
smooth  O

was  O
further  O
accentuated  O
with  O
a  O

For  O
a  O

without  O
burning  O
a  O
hole  O
in  O

,  O
Saveur  O
does  O
manage  O
to  O
lift  O
up  O
to  O
its  O
concept  O
and  O
offering  O
.  O

I  O
can  O
see  O
why  O
the  O
wallet  O
friendly  O
restaurant  O
has  O
a  O
huge  O
following  O
especially  O
with  O
the  O

adjusted  O

I  O
am  O
not  O
particular  O
with  O
what  O
I  O
was  O

that  O
I  O
probably  O
would  O

It  O
was  O
more  O

I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O

that  O
the  O

was  O
not  O

became  O

It  O
still  O

was  O
quite  O
bland  O

the  O

of  O

added  O

which  O
was  O

fried  O
with  O

The  O

paired  O
with  O

was  O
simply  O
a  O

If  O
this  O

I  O

the  O

was  O
more  O

The  O
bbbbbb  O

that  O
there  O

but  O
it  O
was  O
definitely  O
missing  O
for  O

.  O

Flavours  O

the  O

was  O

it  O

It  O
sounds  O

bizzare  O
to  O

The  O
bbbbbb  O
Duck  O

with  O

I  O
have  O
a  O

of  O
everything  O
together  O
but  O
the  O
combination  O
did  O
not  O
have  O
that  O
wow  O
factor  O
.  O

As  O
a  O
dish  O
,  O
I  O
was  O
puzzled  O
with  O
the  O
concept  O
.  O

Individually  O
the  O
duck  O
confit  O
was  O
flavourful  O
and  O
tender  O
.  O

The  O
waffle  O
was  O
also  O
fluffy  O
and  O
delectable  O
with  O
the  O
beautiful  O
blueberry  O
compote  O
.  O

My  O
comfort  O
was  O
that  O
I  O
got  O
both  O

Nicely  O

the  O

hit  O
the  O
right  O
spot  O
for  O
me  O
with  O
the  O

.  O

My  O
only  O
request  O
is  O
to  O
add  O
spinach  O
in  O
between  O
the  O

the  O

The  O

was  O
the  O
star  O
that  O
brought  O
the  O

It  O
was  O

Although  O
I  O
spotted  O

the  O
herby  O

was  O
non  O

it  O

be  O
an  O
disappointment  O

biting  O
into  O
it  O

At  O

the  O

I  O
actually  O
liked  O
that  O
fiery  O
kick  O
from  O
the  O

with  O
the  O

the  O

It  O
was  O

The  O
uncle  O
worked  O
quite  O
fast  O
,  O
so  O
after  O
waiting  O
for  O
about  O
20  O
minutes  O
,  O
I  O
got  O
my  O
sumptuous  O
looking  O
bowl  O
of  O
laksa  O
.  O

Laksa  O
3.5/5  O

A  O
bowl  O
of  O
laksa  O
at  O
Wei  O
Yi  O
ranges  O
from  O
$  O
3  O
to  O
$  O
5  O
depending  O
on  O
the  O
combination  O
of  O
ingredients  O
you  O
preferred  O
.  O

The  O
breakdown  O
of  O
the  O
different  O
combination  O
is  O
readily  O
pasted  O
at  O
the  O
stall  O
.  O

Do  O
note  O
that  O
if  O
you  O
prefer  O
prawn  O
over  O
cockle  O
,  O
go  O
for  O
the  O
prawn  O
combination  O
or  O
else  O
you  O
will  O
get  O
smaller  O
sized  O
prawns  O
.  O

I  O
decided  O
to  O
go  O
for  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Laksa  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
which  O
comes  O
with  O
everything  O
such  O
as  O
poached  O
chicken  O
meat  O
,  O
tao  O
pok  O
,  O
prawns  O
and  O
cockles  O
.  O

While  O
I  O
was  O
delighted  O
that  O
there  O
is  O

in  O

I  O
also  O
missed  O

what  O

about  O

The  O
noodle  O
which  O
was  O
thinner  O
was  O
firm  O
and  O
springy  O
.  O

The  O
tao  O

also  O
managed  O
to  O
soaked  O
up  O
the  O

and  O
had  O
a  O
delightful  O
bite  O
to  O
it  O
.  O

I  O
usually  O
will  O
drink  O
up  O
the  O
whole  O
bowl  O
of  O
laksa  O
gravy  O
but  O
I  O
did  O
not  O
manage  O
to  O
do  O
so  O
this  O
time  O
.  O

The  O
bowl  O
of  O
laksa  O
did  O
look  O
thick  O
and  O
creamy  O
but  O
in  O
term  O
of  O
taste  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
lacking  O
something  O
.  O

Something  O
that  O
gave  O
that  O
lemak  O
satisfaction  O
when  O
you  O
slurped  O
into  O
a  O
bowl  O
of  O

.  O

Overall  O
Wei  O
Yi  O

Laksa  O
is  O
value  O
for  O
money  O
with  O
their  O
generous  O
serving  O
.  O

The  O
bowl  O
of  O
laksa  O
did  O
come  O
with  O
a  O
rustic  O
tradition  O
taste  O
that  O
brought  O
back  O
memories  O
of  O
my  O
childhood  O
.  O

For  O
a  O
short  O
moment  O
,  O
the  O
memory  O
of  O
my  O
grandma  O
and  O
me  O
having  O
a  O
bowl  O
of  O
laksa  O
did  O
flash  O
across  O
my  O
mind  O
.  O

My  O

used  O
to  O
bring  O

I  O
understood  O
the  O
overwhelming  O
response  O
because  O
we  O
were  O
at  O

to  O
indulge  O
in  O

the  O
classic  O

We  O
were  O

very  O
fortunately  O
to  O
be  O
allowed  O
into  O

experienced  O

Deep  O
Fried  O
Chicken  O

4/5  O

The  O
bbbbbb  O
Deep  O
Fried  O
Chicken  O
Liver  O
with  O
Pig  O
Caul  O
/bbbbbb  O
is  O
a  O
tedious  O
dish  O
to  O
make  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
not  O
a  O
surprise  O
that  O
it  O
is  O
rarely  O
being  O
offered  O
in  O
restaurants  O
nowadays  O
.  O

I  O
can  O
appreciate  O
the  O
labour  O
behind  O
the  O
dish  O
in  O
assembling  O
all  O
the  O
components  O
of  O
the  O
dish  O
to  O
together  O
.  O

Being  O
a  O
fan  O
of  O
innards  O
and  O
salted  O
egg  O
,  O
the  O
dish  O
definitely  O
hits  O
the  O
soft  O
spot  O
of  O
me  O
with  O
its  O
flavour  O
and  O
texture  O
.  O

Drunken  O
Chicken  O
2.8/5  O

This  O
really  O
got  O
me  O
drunken  O
of  O
words  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O
really  O
could  O
hold  O
its  O
liqueur  O
well  O
,  O
it  O
probably  O
took  O
a  O
whole  O
bottle  O
of  O
the  O
alcohol  O
to  O
knock  O
the  O
chicken  O
out  O
.  O

The  O
beautifully  O
poached  O
bbbbbb  O
Drunken  O
Chicken  O
/bbbbbb  O
unfortunately  O
has  O
a  O
drink  O
too  O
much  O
that  O
the  O
bitterness  O
of  O
alcohol  O
had  O
overpowered  O
the  O
sweetness  O
of  O
the  O
chicken  O
.  O

Golden  O

Chicken  O
3/5  O

Having  O
an  O
interesting  O
name  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Golden  O
Coin  O
Chicken  O
/bbbbbb  O
actually  O
involved  O
no  O
chicken  O
at  O
all  O
.  O

This  O
traditional  O
Cantonese  O
roast  O
is  O
made  O
with  O
candied  O
pork  O
lard  O
,  O
ham  O
and  O
pork  O
loin  O
that  O
involved  O
skewering  O
and  O
BBQ  O
.  O

I  O
can  O
taste  O
the  O
delectable  O
flavours  O
but  O
I  O
have  O
a  O
hard  O
time  O
appreciating  O
it  O

Minced  O

I  O
have  O
my  O
reservation  O
with  O
the  O
Minced  O
Venison  O
with  O
Rice  O
Crust  O
.  O

I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
crackling  O
texture  O
of  O
the  O
rice  O
crust  O
but  O
some  O
how  O
I  O
just  O
did  O
not  O
feel  O
that  O
the  O
minced  O
venison  O
together  O
with  O
the  O
rice  O
crust  O
felt  O
more  O
distant  O
in  O
individual  O
goodness  O
instead  O
of  O
coming  O
together  O
as  O
a  O
complete  O
dish  O

The  O
bbbbbb  O
Double  O
Chicken  O

with  O

/bbbbbb  O
was  O

the  O

of  O
the  O

,  O
both  O
nourishing  O
and  O
rejuvenating  O

about  O
it  O

I  O
can  O
imagine  O
this  O
should  O
be  O
considered  O

probably  O
only  O
enjoyed  O

the  O

Curry  O
Fish  O
Head  O
3.5/5  O

One  O
of  O
the  O
reasons  O
why  O
we  O
are  O
at  O
Madam  O
Kwan  O
is  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Curry  O
Fish  O
Head  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
49  O
)  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
price  O
we  O
are  O
paying  O
,  O
its  O
quite  O
a  O
big  O
pot  O
of  O
curry  O
with  O
lady  O
fingers  O
,  O
brinjal  O
and  O
Tau  O
Pok  O
.  O

We  O
checked  O
with  O
the  O
waiter  O
and  O
understand  O
the  O
pot  O
of  O
curry  O
was  O
cooked  O
the  O
same  O
way  O
it  O
is  O
done  O
in  O
Malaysia  O
except  O
that  O
the  O
chilli  O
paste  O
is  O
different  O
due  O
to  O
some  O
ingredient  O
import  O
requirement  O
.  O

When  O
we  O
tasted  O
the  O
curry  O
broth  O
,  O
all  O
of  O
us  O
has  O
that  O
puzzled  O
look  O
at  O
one  O
another  O
.  O

The  O
curry  O
broth  O
is  O
something  O
that  O
is  O
new  O
to  O
our  O
palate  O
and  O
not  O
the  O
usual  O
curry  O
we  O
have  O
in  O
Singapore  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
lost  O
of  O
words  O
to  O
describe  O
it  O
but  O
it  O
may  O
take  O
a  O
while  O
for  O
the  O
local  O
palate  O
to  O
accept  O
it  O
.  O

However  O
,  O
the  O
noteworthy  O
was  O
the  O
Tau  O
Pok  O
.  O

The  O
huge  O
as  O
a  O
fishball  O
Tau  O
Pok  O
not  O
only  O
was  O
crisp  O
on  O
the  O
outside  O
but  O
it  O
still  O
had  O
that  O
soft  O
spongy  O
interior  O
bite  O
to  O
it  O
.  O

Finally  O
I  O

The  O

are  O

and  O
tasty  O
in  O
its  O
own  O
right  O
but  O
the  O
star  O
has  O
to  O
be  O
the  O
rice  O
.  O

The  O
rice  O
was  O
fluffy  O
and  O
beautifully  O
fragrant  O
by  O
the  O
aromatic  O
coconut  O
milk  O
which  O
was  O
so  O
good  O
that  O
I  O
can  O
eat  O
it  O

though  O

have  O
not  O
been  O
to  O

,  O
I  O
have  O
already  O
heard  O
much  O
about  O
the  O

created  O
by  O

.  O

I  O
am  O
glad  O
that  O

ordered  O
the  O

which  O
comes  O

,  O
assam  O
prawns  O
,  O
shredded  O
beef  O
redang  O
and  O
a  O
huge  O
chicken  O

.  O

The  O
drumstick  O
was  O
fried  O
to  O
a  O
nice  O
crisp  O
on  O
the  O
skin  O
but  O
still  O
tender  O
and  O
juicy  O
inside  O
.  O

While  O
the  O
assam  O
prawn  O
was  O
lip  O
smacking  O
,  O
the  O
shredded  O

redang  O
was  O
missing  O

,  O
the  O
clear  O

is  O

.  O

The  O
chicken  O

was  O
well  O
marinated  O
and  O
succulent  O
.  O

The  O
flavour  O
was  O
further  O
accentuated  O
by  O
the  O

On  O
the  O

used  O
the  O

base  O
of  O
the  O

fish  O

.  O

The  O
curry  O
broth  O
was  O
not  O
as  O
flavourful  O
compared  O
to  O
the  O
curry  O
fish  O
head  O
.  O

It  O
lacked  O
that  O
spicy  O

kick  O
that  O
I  O
have  O
grown  O
up  O
to  O
associate  O
with  O
.  O

Although  O
the  O
portion  O
served  O
at  O
Madam  O

is  O
bigger  O
in  O
portion  O
compare  O
to  O
what  O
you  O
can  O
get  O
at  O
hawker  O
,  O
I  O
still  O
can  O
not  O
get  O
over  O
that  O
fact  O
that  O
it  O
is  O
so  O
pricey  O
for  O
hawker  O
fare  O
.  O

Yes  O
it  O
comes  O
with  O
better  O
quality  O

and  O

but  O

are  O
meant  O

be  O
affordable  O
.  O

I  O
walked  O
away  O
asking  O
myself  O
whether  O
I  O
will  O

Probably  O

In  O
recent  O
time  O
,  O
it  O
seems  O
like  O
Singapore  O
is  O
gradually  O
turning  O
into  O
a  O
little  O
Melbourne  O
with  O
new  O
cafes  O
opening  O
in  O
every  O
corners  O
of  O
Singapore  O
.  O

Among  O
these  O
wave  O
of  O
new  O
coffee  O
culture  O
in  O
Singapore  O
,  O
bbbbbb  O
Department  O
of  O
Caffeine  O
(  O
DOC  O
)  O
/bbbbbb  O
has  O
gained  O
a  O
group  O
of  O
followers  O
and  O
fan  O
base  O
with  O
the  O
coffee  O
and  O
food  O
.  O

The  O
cafe  O
located  O
at  O
the  O
start  O
of  O
Duxton  O
Road  O
occupying  O
a  O
corner  O
unit  O
was  O
rather  O
unnoticeable  O
.  O

If  O
not  O
that  O
I  O
have  O
known  O
the  O
address  O
beforehand  O
I  O
would  O
have  O
missed  O
it  O
.  O

The  O
peaceful  O
stretch  O
of  O
Duxton  O
Road  O
was  O
quickly  O
interrupted  O
by  O
the  O
buzzing  O
activities  O
inside  O
the  O
cafe  O
where  O
I  O
pushed  O
open  O
the  O
entry  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
taken  O
back  O
by  O
the  O
vibe  O
inside  O
the  O
cafe  O
that  O
is  O
packed  O
to  O
the  O
brim  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
like  O
stepping  O
into  O
another  O
world  O
.  O

The  O

at  O

I  O
had  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Latte  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O

)  O
which  O
I  O
did  O
not  O
enjoy  O
.  O

While  O
the  O
coffee  O
is  O
rich  O
and  O
strong  O
,  O
I  O
wanted  O
more  O
milk  O
for  O
my  O
latte  O
which  O
was  O
definitely  O
missing  O
.  O

The  O
bbbbbb  O
Lavendar  O

/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
was  O
a  O
turn  O
off  O
with  O
the  O
dry  O
texture  O
.  O

The  O
overly  O
perfumed  O
lavendar  O
flavour  O
of  O
the  O
cake  O
made  O
it  O
tasted  O
artificial  O
.  O

Buttermilk  O
Waffles  O
2.5/5  O

I  O
also  O
tried  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Buttermilk  O
Waffles  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
13.50  O
)  O
that  O
was  O
topped  O
with  O
butter  O
rum  O
banana  O
and  O
a  O
scoop  O
of  O
vanilla  O
ice  O
cream  O
.  O

While  O
the  O
waffle  O
was  O
thick  O
and  O
fluffy  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
limp  O
and  O
not  O
crispy  O
.  O

It  O
felt  O
that  O
the  O
waffle  O
had  O
sat  O
for  O
too  O
long  O
after  O
it  O
had  O
been  O
made  O
.  O

During  O
my  O
visit  O
,  O
all  O
the  O
eggs  O
item  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
was  O
crossed  O
out  O
.  O

My  O
friend  O
checked  O
and  O
the  O
waiter  O
replied  O
that  O
they  O
have  O
run  O
out  O
of  O
eggs  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
have  O
love  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
brunch  O
items  O
and  O
have  O
a  O
more  O
complete  O
review  O
of  O
the  O
hype  O
of  O
this  O
place  O
.  O

Maybe  O
I  O
should  O
drop  O
by  O
the  O
cafe  O
another  O
time  O
when  O
I  O
am  O
in  O
the  O
vicinity  O

nothing  O

Not  O

somehow  O
the  O

lost  O

the  O

the  O

was  O
disappointment  O

The  O
philosophy  O
of  O
Chef  O

culinary  O
approach  O
to  O
food  O
can  O
be  O
clearly  O
appreciated  O
in  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Hamachi  O
Carambola  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O

.  O

The  O
Hamachi  O
was  O
cured  O
in  O
seasonal  O
citrus  O
fruits  O
and  O
served  O
with  O
pickled  O
starfruit  O

pickled  O
garlic  O
,  O
dehydrated  O
melon  O
flavoured  O
with  O

I  O
was  O
told  O
to  O
have  O
a  O
bit  O
of  O
everything  O
on  O
the  O
plate  O
together  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
glad  O
that  O
I  O
followed  O
the  O
advice  O
as  O
I  O
was  O
blown  O
away  O
by  O
how  O
perfect  O
the  O
accompaniments  O
accentuated  O
the  O

to  O
a  O

half  O

before  O
being  O
confited  O
in  O

The  O

was  O
cooked  O
to  O

that  O
simply  O
melted  O
in  O
the  O
mouth  O

Love  O
the  O

.  O

Recently  O
I  O
watched  O
Masterchef  O
China  O

got  O
to  O
know  O
that  O
chocolate  O
if  O
used  O
correctly  O
can  O
enhance  O
the  O
flavour  O
of  O
seafood  O
.  O

Coincidentally  O
the  O

was  O
dusted  O
with  O

and  O
I  O
was  O
able  O
to  O
experience  O
first  O

the  O
wonderful  O

of  O
the  O

accentuating  O
the  O

a  O

The  O

was  O
a  O

The  O
concept  O
at  O

is  O
rather  O
simple  O
,  O
you  O
either  O
choose  O
a  O

fast  O

as  O
their  O

it  O

A  O
thing  O
to  O
note  O
at  O
Triple-O  O
's  O
is  O
that  O
the  O
burger  O
's  O
pickle  O
is  O
served  O
separately  O
.  O

Some  O
customers  O
do  O
not  O
like  O
pickle  O
and  O
I  O
thought  O
this  O
is  O
a  O
good  O
way  O
for  O
them  O
to  O
decide  O
themselves  O
whether  O
to  O
add  O
the  O
pickle  O
to  O
their  O
burger  O
or  O
not  O
.  O

The  O
bbbbbb  O

was  O
pretty  O

.  O

Each  O
bite  O
came  O
with  O
delightful  O
crispy  O
bacon  O
as  O
the  O
freshly  O
made  O

was  O
fully  O
wrapped  O

which  O
you  O
have  O
a  O
choice  O
to  O
whether  O
add  O
to  O
your  O
burger  O
.  O

While  O
the  O
fish  O
fillet  O
was  O
thick  O
and  O
moist  O
,  O
I  O
felt  O
the  O
burger  O
lacked  O
a  O
satisfying  O
sauce  O
to  O
hold  O
it  O
together  O
.  O

As  O
the  O
burger  O
comes  O
in  O
2  O
separate  O
fillets  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
also  O
a  O
bit  O
difficult  O
to  O
handle  O
and  O
eat  O
.  O

With  O
the  O
availability  O
of  O

I  O
have  O
to  O
confess  O
that  O
I  O
have  O
not  O
heard  O
of  O
bbbbbb  O
Triple-O  O

/bbbbbb  O
until  O
my  O
recent  O
visit  O
to  O
the  O
burger  O
chain  O
at  O
Orchard  O

.  O

The  O
popular  O
burger  O
chain  O
from  O
bbbbbb  O
Vancouver  O
since  O
1928  O
/bbbbbb  O
has  O
quietly  O
come  O
to  O
our  O
shore  O
without  O
much  O
rah-rah  O
.  O

Can  O
you  O
believe  O
that  O
this  O
burger  O
chain  O
is  O
older  O
than  O
Macdonald  O
?  O

Currently  O
they  O
have  O
3  O
outlets  O
at  O
Orchard  O
Tower  O
,  O
Star  O

and  O
Asia  O

Triple  O

proud  O
themselves  O
for  O
serving  O
the  O
sauciest  O

juiciest  O

tastiest  O
and  O
bestest  O

Triple-O  O

Breakfast  O
Club  O
Burger  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O

)  O
.  O

The  O
burger  O
which  O
comes  O
with  O
bacon  O
,  O
egg  O
and  O
hashbrown  O
is  O
sandwiched  O
in  O
a  O
delectable  O
soft  O
bun  O
and  O
drenched  O
with  O
a  O
delish  O
special  O
sauce  O
.  O

Triple-O  O
's  O
is  O
not  O
exactly  O
a  O
fast  O
food  O
chain  O
as  O
their  O
burgers  O
are  O
freshly  O
made  O
to  O
order  O
,  O
so  O
do  O
expect  O
to  O
wait  O
around  O
7  O
minutes  O
before  O
it  O
is  O
served  O
.  O

What  O
is  O
having  O
a  O

.  O

The  O
bbbbbb  O

was  O
crispy  O

and  O
soft  O
inside  O
served  O
with  O

while  O
the  O

Bacon  O

Burger  O
4.2/5  O

A  O
thing  O
to  O
note  O
at  O
Triple-O  O
's  O
is  O
that  O
the  O
burger  O
's  O
pickle  O
is  O
served  O
separately  O
.  O

Some  O
customers  O
do  O
not  O
like  O
pickle  O
and  O
I  O
thought  O
this  O
is  O
a  O
good  O
way  O
for  O
them  O
to  O
decide  O
themselves  O
whether  O
to  O
add  O
the  O
pickle  O
to  O
their  O
burger  O
or  O
not  O
.  O

The  O
bbbbbb  O
Bacon  O
Cheese  O
Burger  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
12.90  O
)  O
was  O
pretty  O
juicy  O
and  O
tasty  O
.  O

Each  O
bite  O
came  O
with  O
delightful  O
crispy  O
bacon  O
as  O
the  O
freshly  O
made  O
beef  O
patty  O
was  O
fully  O
wrapped  O
with  O
bacon  O
.  O

Fish  O
Burger  O
3.5/5  O

The  O
bbbbbb  O
Fish  O
Burger  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
13.90  O
)  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
fried  O
pickle  O
which  O
you  O
have  O
a  O
choice  O
to  O
whether  O
add  O
to  O
your  O
burger  O
.  O

While  O
the  O
fish  O
fillet  O
was  O
thick  O
and  O
moist  O
,  O
I  O
felt  O
the  O
burger  O
lacked  O
a  O
satisfying  O
sauce  O
to  O
hold  O
it  O
together  O
.  O

As  O
the  O
burger  O
comes  O
in  O
2  O
separate  O
fillets  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
also  O
a  O
bit  O
difficult  O
to  O
handle  O
and  O
eat  O
.  O

With  O
the  O
availability  O
of  O
space  O
at  O
the  O

For  O
the  O

I  O
have  O
been  O
seeing  O
people  O
talking  O
about  O
Yuet  O

My  O
partner  O
brought  O
me  O
to  O
the  O
popular  O
stall  O
because  O
her  O
mum  O
frequent  O
this  O
zichar  O
stall  O
and  O
always  O
brought  O
home  O
delectable  O
food  O
.  O

The  O
stall  O
is  O
located  O
right  O
at  O
the  O

the  O

It  O
was  O
my  O
first  O
time  O

the  O
stall  O
so  O
I  O
was  O
also  O
not  O
very  O
sure  O
what  O
to  O
order  O
.  O

I  O
decided  O
to  O
go  O
for  O
the  O
easy  O
way  O
out  O
and  O
ordered  O
2  O
dishes  O
that  O
is  O
recommended  O
on  O
their  O
stall  O

.  O

The  O
zichar  O
stall  O
is  O
really  O
popular  O
and  O
we  O
needed  O
to  O
wait  O
for  O
a  O
good  O
40  O
minutes  O
for  O
our  O
food  O
.  O

Fish  O
Chicken  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O

The  O

the  O

worked  O
perfectly  O

dish  O
to  O

with  O

I  O
was  O
hoping  O
that  O
I  O
can  O
have  O
more  O
of  O
the  O
salted  O

like  O
a  O

The  O
question  O
has  O
been  O
asked  O
,  O
where  O
is  O
the  O
best  O
Popiah  O
in  O
Singapore  O
?  O

I  O
am  O
sure  O
many  O
has  O
their  O
own  O
favourite  O
but  O
I  O
have  O
been  O
hearing  O
about  O
the  O
queue  O
at  O
this  O
small  O
stall  O
tucked  O
again  O
in  O
a  O
corner  O
ofa  O
coffeeshop  O
at  O
Clementi  O
Avenue  O
3  O
where  O
the  O
popular  O
Brothers  O
Rojak  O
is  O
located  O
.  O

The  O
stall  O
known  O
as  O
Jit  O
It  O
Thai  O
San  O
Popiah  O
(  O
)  O
is  O
run  O
by  O
2  O
elderly  O
while  O
the  O
lady  O
auntie  O
is  O
incharge  O
of  O
making  O
the  O
popiah  O
.  O

When  O
I  O
reached  O
the  O
stall  O
,  O
there  O
was  O
already  O
aqueue  O
.  O

I  O
patiently  O
waited  O
for  O
a  O
good  O
25  O
minutes  O
for  O
my  O
popiah  O
although  O
there  O
was  O
just  O
like  O
4-5  O
people  O
in  O
front  O
of  O
me  O
.  O

To  O
be  O
frank  O
,  O
it  O
can  O
be  O
faster  O
but  O
I  O
think  O
age  O
has  O
caught  O
up  O
with  O
the  O
owners  O
and  O
theie  O
pace  O
has  O
slowed  O
down  O
.  O

When  O
I  O
was  O
queuing  O
for  O
my  O
turn  O
,  O
I  O
post  O
on  O
facebook  O
that  O
I  O
am  O
checking  O
out  O
this  O
popiah  O
stall  O
and  O
I  O
was  O
warned  O
to  O
keep  O
my  O
order  O
simple  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
received  O
a  O
text  O
from  O
my  O
partner  O
that  O
the  O
auntie  O
is  O
quite  O
fierce  O
.  O

True  O
enough  O
,  O
a  O
lady  O
in  O
front  O
of  O
me  O
wasscolded  O
by  O
the  O
stallauntie  O
for  O
her  O
confusing  O
order  O
.  O

Upon  O
my  O
turn  O
,  O
I  O
kept  O
it  O
simple  O
and  O
ordered  O
2  O
Popiah  O
roll  O
(  O
$  O
1.50  O
each  O
)  O
,  O
one  O
with  O
chilli  O
and  O
the  O
other  O
without  O
.  O

When  O
she  O
finished  O
preparing  O
the  O
popiah  O
.  O

you  O
place  O
the  O
money  O
on  O
the  O
plastic  O
tray  O
for  O
her  O
to  O
collect  O
.  O

Popiah  O
4/5  O

I  O
feel  O
thatthe  O
popiah  O
at  O
Jit  O
It  O
Thai  O
San  O
Popiah  O
stands  O
out  O
in  O
3  O
areas  O
.  O

First  O
is  O
the  O
thin  O
and  O
soft  O
popiah  O
skin  O
that  O
is  O
stuffed  O
with  O
turnips  O
,  O
beansprouts  O
,  O
hard  O
boiled  O
eggs  O
and  O
peanuts  O
.  O

Second  O
,  O
the  O
popiah  O
comes  O
with  O
garlic  O
which  O
further  O
enhanced  O
the  O
flavour  O
.  O

Lastly  O
,  O
the  O
special  O
chilli  O
that  O
will  O
send  O
the  O
tasting  O
buds  O
sambal  O
dancing  O
.  O

The  O
cafe  O
serves  O
coffee  O
crafted  O
from  O
a  O
blend  O
of  O
Sidama  O
,  O
Antigua  O
and  O
Lintong  O
while  O
some  O
small  O
bites  O
are  O
also  O
sold  O
here  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
almost  O
7pmwhen  O
I  O
visited  O
Kiasu  O
Espresso  O
hence  O
the  O
cafe  O
was  O
rather  O
empty  O
since  O
it  O
was  O
dinner  O
time.I  O
was  O
looknig  O
for  O
a  O
place  O
to  O
hang  O
out  O
while  O
I  O
waited  O
for  O
my  O
dinner  O
at  O
8pm  O
which  O
is  O
just  O
next  O
door  O
atBar-Roque  O
Grill  O
.  O

Latte  O
and  O
Macchiato  O
3/5  O

I  O
ordered  O
a  O
cup  O
of  O
Latte  O
while  O
my  O
friend  O
has  O
the  O
Macchiato  O
.  O

I  O
know  O
my  O
people  O
has  O
good  O
words  O
for  O
the  O
coffee  O
at  O
Kiasu  O
Espresso  O
but  O
I  O
did  O
not  O
enjoy  O
my  O
caffeine  O
.  O

I  O
found  O
the  O
blend  O
too  O
bitter  O
to  O
my  O
liking  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
so  O
bitter  O
that  O
I  O
was  O
wondering  O
whether  O
milk  O
was  O
added  O
.  O

By  O
the  O
way  O
I  O
always  O
have  O
latte  O
without  O
sugar  O
.  O

Chocolate  O
Tart  O
1/5  O

As  O
it  O
was  O
quite  O
late  O
already  O
,  O
there  O
was  O
n't  O
much  O
to  O
choose  O
for  O
our  O
snack  O
.  O

We  O
ended  O
up  O
with  O
a  O
Chocolate  O
Tart  O
which  O
added  O
to  O
our  O
misery  O
.  O

First  O
the  O
tart  O
was  O
being  O
heated  O
up  O
until  O
the  O
dark  O
chocolate  O
filling  O
turned  O
into  O
molten  O
form  O
with  O
a  O
weird  O
plastic  O
like  O
layer  O
on  O
top  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
really  O
unappertising  O
and  O
weird  O
that  O
we  O
left  O
it  O
basically  O
untouched  O
.  O

While  O
my  O
experience  O
at  O
Kiasu  O
Espresso  O
is  O
not  O
the  O
best  O
,  O
I  O
may  O
still  O
go  O
back  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
pastry  O
there  O
since  O
they  O
are  O
from  O
Tiong  O
Bahru  O
Bakery  O
.  O

Hopefully  O
the  O
coffee  O
will  O
be  O
better  O
in  O
my  O
next  O
visit  O
,  O
maybe  O
the  O
barista  O
has  O
a  O
bad  O
day  O

This  O
is  O
a  O
super  O
overdue  O
post  O
dated  O
back  O
in  O
June  O
2013  O
when  O
we  O
celebrated  O
Jacob  O
and  O
Shiting  O
's  O
birthday  O
at  O
Hai  O
Di  O
Lao  O
Hotpot  O
(  O
)  O
.  O

Founded  O
in  O
Sichuan  O
back  O
in  O
1994  O
,  O
Hai  O
Di  O
Lao  O
Hotpot  O
has  O
been  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
biggest  O
hotpot  O
chain  O
in  O
China  O
with  O
over  O
50  O
outlets  O
in  O
different  O
major  O
cities  O
of  O
China  O
.  O

After  O
their  O
recent  O
opening  O
in  O
Singapore  O
,  O
it  O
has  O
received  O
many  O
good  O
reviews  O
for  O
their  O
food  O
and  O
excellent  O
service  O
drawing  O
daily  O
long  O
queues  O
.  O

To  O
avoid  O
disappointment  O
,  O
I  O
called  O
weeks  O
in  O
advance  O
and  O
was  O
told  O
to  O
come  O
at  O
6pm  O
or  O
I  O
will  O
have  O
to  O
queue  O
like  O
the  O
rest  O
.  O

At  O
Hai  O
Di  O
Lao  O
Hotpot  O
,  O
there  O
is  O
a  O
section  O
where  O
you  O
can  O
help  O
yourself  O
to  O
free  O
flow  O
appertizer  O
and  O
fruits  O
.  O

You  O
can  O
also  O
mix  O
and  O
match  O
your  O
own  O
dipping  O
sauce  O
to  O
go  O
with  O
your  O
hotpot  O
cooked  O
food  O
.  O

My  O
memory  O
is  O
failing  O
me  O
and  O
I  O
could  O
not  O
remember  O
the  O
price  O
and  O
what  O
exactly  O
we  O
have  O
ordered  O
.  O

If  O
I  O
am  O
not  O
wrong  O
,  O
we  O
ordered  O
the  O
Assorted  O
Vegetables  O
and  O
Assorted  O
Mushrooms  O
to  O
start  O
with  O
.  O

Ordering  O
is  O
done  O
through  O
the  O
ipad  O
but  O
the  O
service  O
staff  O
is  O
always  O
there  O
to  O
help  O
whenever  O
if  O
you  O
need  O
it  O
.  O

IfI  O
remembered  O
correctly  O
,  O
this  O
isthe  O
Meat  O
Dumpling  O
which  O
was  O
packed  O
with  O
delectable  O
fillings  O
which  O
we  O
all  O
enjoyed  O
.  O

We  O
also  O
have  O
the  O
Kurobota  O
Pork  O
,  O
Fish  O
Slices  O
and  O
Hai  O
Di  O
Lao  O
Flavoured  O
Beef  O
to  O
go  O
with  O
our  O
Seafood  O
and  O
Spicy  O
Soup  O
Base  O
.  O

Be  O
warned  O
that  O
their  O
Spicy  O
soup  O
base  O
is  O
fiery  O
.  O

We  O
have  O
to  O
reduce  O
the  O
spiciness  O
by  O
diluting  O
it  O
with  O
the  O
seafood  O
broth  O
.  O

The  O
menu  O
offers  O
quite  O
an  O
extensive  O
selection  O
of  O
fresh  O
and  O
quality  O
meat  O
too  O
.  O

Just  O
be  O
careful  O
with  O
your  O
selection  O
if  O
you  O
do  O
n't  O
want  O
to  O
burn  O
a  O
hole  O
in  O
your  O
wallet  O

gave  O
a  O
sweet  O
ending  O
change  O
after  O
all  O
the  O
fried  O
stuff  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
not  O
too  O
sure  O
but  O
the  O
pineapple  O
tasted  O
as  O
it  O
was  O
from  O
the  O
can  O
fried  O
in  O
a  O
light  O
batter  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
nice  O

nothing  O
much  O
to  O

about  O
.  O

Battered  O

My  O
first  O
encounter  O
of  O
bbbbbb  O
deep  O
fried  O
MARS  O
bar  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
was  O
at  O
The  O
Ascot  O
.  O

The  O
version  O
at  O
Smiths  O
was  O
sweet  O
,  O
sticky  O
and  O
a  O
crispy  O
batter  O
to  O
balance  O
the  O
sweetness  O
as  O
well  O
as  O
giving  O
it  O
a  O
crunch  O
.  O

At  O
Smiths  O
British  O
Fish  O

,  O
my  O
recommendation  O
is  O
not  O
to  O
be  O
overwhelmed  O
by  O
all  O
the  O
fried  O
stuff  O
.  O

Go  O
for  O
the  O

add  O
some  O

when  O
it  O
first  O

at  O

.  O

Tim  O
Ho  O
Wan  O
Singapore  O
has  O
since  O
tweaked  O
the  O
recipe  O
and  O
accordingly  O
to  O
someone  O
who  O
has  O
tried  O
the  O
same  O
item  O
in  O
Hong  O
Kong  O
,  O
the  O
Singapore  O
version  O
is  O
now  O
closer  O
to  O
what  O
she  O
had  O
in  O
Hong  O
Kong  O
.  O

Now  O
the  O
baked  O
bun  O
has  O
a  O
sweet  O
crispy  O
custard  O
layer  O
on  O
the  O
exterior  O
compared  O
to  O
the  O

version  O
I  O
had  O
while  O
it  O
also  O
reduced  O
the  O
sweetness  O
level  O
of  O
the  O
fillings  O
.  O

I  O
actually  O
tasted  O
quite  O
similar  O
to  O
Bo  O

with  O
the  O
sweet  O

exterior  O

Steamed  O

Tim  O

has  O
come  O
up  O
with  O
6  O
new  O

only  O
at  O

these  O
are  O
only  O

every  O

One  O
of  O
these  O

is  O

Chicken  O

is  O
one  O
of  O
those  O
item  O
I  O
will  O
definitely  O
order  O
when  O
I  O
have  O
dim  O

and  O
I  O
am  O
glad  O
Tim  O

finally  O
introduced  O
it  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
find  O
that  O
the  O
abalone  O
sauce  O
is  O
a  O
good  O
change  O
to  O
what  O
we  O
usually  O
have  O
in  O

As  O

has  O
mentioned  O
in  O
his  O
earlier  O
interview  O
,  O
he  O
realised  O
Singaporean  O
loves  O
their  O

.  O

Hence  O
it  O
is  O
not  O
a  O

a  O

both  O

/bbbbbb  O
(  O

.  O

I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
flavour  O
and  O
texture  O
of  O
the  O
roll  O
but  O
I  O
doubt  O
this  O
will  O
be  O
greatly  O
accepted  O
by  O
the  O
local  O
as  O
its  O
plain  O
vermicelli  O
roll  O
without  O
fillings  O
.  O

Fried  O
Noodle  O
with  O
BBQ  O
Pork  O
and  O
Soy  O
Sauce  O

I  O
know  O
the  O
people  O
in  O
Hong  O
Kong  O
loves  O
their  O
congee  O
and  O
noodles  O
for  O
breakfast  O
or  O
dim  O
sum  O
but  O
I  O
doubt  O
Singaporean  O
shares  O
the  O
same  O
palate  O
for  O
it  O
.  O

As  O
a  O

itself  O

was  O
delectable  O
with  O
springy  O
noodles  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
just  O
not  O
sure  O
whether  O
Singaporean  O
will  O
order  O
it  O
for  O
dim  O
sum  O
.  O

bbbbbb  O
Deep  O
Fried  O
Dumpling  O
with  O
Salted  O
Meat  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O

is  O
a  O
new  O
dim  O
sum  O
dish  O
not  O
many  O
Singaporean  O
is  O
familiar  O
with  O
.  O

Accordingly  O
to  O
what  O
I  O
know  O
,  O
this  O
is  O
quite  O
popular  O
in  O
Hong  O
Kong  O
.  O

The  O
deep  O
fried  O
dumpling  O
is  O
actually  O
hollow  O
in  O
the  O
middle  O
filled  O
only  O
about  O
a  O
quarter  O
in  O
it  O
with  O
salted  O
meat  O
.  O

The  O
highlight  O
of  O
this  O
dim  O
sum  O
item  O
is  O
the  O
chewy  O
texture  O
of  O
the  O
deep  O
fried  O
dumpling  O
.  O

The  O

I  O

.  O

I  O
only  O
hope  O
that  O
there  O
were  O
more  O

to  O
give  O

it  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
subtle  O

gelatinous  O

I  O

bring  O

With  O
the  O

,  O
hopefully  O
the  O

will  O
be  O
thinner  O

more  O

can  O

like  O
the  O

that  O
the  O

The  O
beauty  O
of  O
cooking  O
with  O
Tandoor  O
is  O
that  O
it  O
uses  O
the  O
radiant  O
heat  O
of  O
the  O
charcoal  O
to  O
cook  O
the  O
food  O
,  O
locking  O
the  O
juiciness  O
of  O
the  O
meat  O
as  O
well  O
as  O
being  O
fragrant  O

in  O
the  O

in  O
1963  O

Founded  O
by  O
the  O

Mr  O
Wong  O

and  O
Madam  O

located  O
along  O
Cantonment  O
Road  O
(  O
now  O

)  O
serving  O
Cantonese  O
Claypot  O
cuisines  O
before  O
moving  O
to  O
the  O
current  O
location  O
in  O
2003  O
.  O

The  O

won  O
many  O

also  O
realised  O
that  O

of  O
the  O
table  O
ordered  O
similar  O

scrambled  O
eggs  O
,  O
wrapped  O
it  O
with  O
the  O

and  O
eat  O

an  O

bbbbbb  O
Signature  O
Stone  O
Restaurant  O
/bbbbbb  O
is  O
the  O
newkid  O
at  O
the  O
row  O
of  O
shop  O
houses  O
along  O
Havelock  O
Road  O
where  O
it  O
houses  O
the  O
popular  O
G7  O
Liang  O
Kee  O
,  O
Mu  O
Liang  O
Zai  O
Liang  O
Kee  O
and  O
several  O
other  O
eateries  O
.  O

The  O
concept  O
is  O
quite  O
similar  O
to  O
claypot  O
rice  O
except  O
that  O
it  O
uses  O
stone  O
pot  O
that  O
retains  O
the  O
heatand  O
keeping  O
the  O
food  O
warm  O
.  O

As  O
I  O
was  O
worried  O
that  O
the  O
lunch  O
would  O
beheavy  O
,  O
I  O
asked  O
Nicole  O
and  O
Kimberly  O
to  O
join  O
me  O
.  O

Stone  O

We  O
started  O
lunch  O
with  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Stone  O
Pot  O
Big  O
Prawns  O
Soup  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O

.  O

Swimming  O
in  O
the  O
pot  O
of  O
hot  O
piping  O
soup  O
,  O
the  O
tiger  O
prawns  O
were  O
big  O
and  O
crunchy  O
.  O

The  O
hearty  O
soup  O
was  O
packed  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
balanced  O
of  O
herbs  O
and  O
distinct  O
prawns  O
flavours  O
which  O
really  O
surprised  O
me  O
with  O
its  O
watered  O
down  O
appearance  O
.  O

Wine  O
Chicken  O
3.5/5  O

When  O
I  O
ordered  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Wine  O
Chicken  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
8  O
)  O
side  O
dish  O
,  O
I  O
thought  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
dish  O
similar  O
to  O
the  O
Shanghai  O
Drunken  O
Chicken  O
.  O

I  O
did  O
not  O
expect  O
that  O
it  O
is  O
served  O
in  O
a  O
stone  O
pot  O
of  O
chicken  O
pieces  O
,  O
mushroom  O
and  O
chilli  O
.  O

While  O
the  O
dish  O
was  O
nice  O
and  O
enjoyable  O
,  O
I  O
could  O
not  O
taste  O
any  O
traces  O
of  O
wine  O
in  O
the  O
dish  O
.  O

Onion  O
Cheese  O
Mushroom  O
Omelette  O
3/5  O

I  O
was  O
craving  O
for  O
egg  O
so  O
I  O
ordered  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Onion  O
Cheese  O
Mushroom  O
Omelette  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
6  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
omelette  O
was  O
nothing  O
fancy  O
just  O
homely  O
cooked  O
food  O
that  O
was  O
thick  O
and  O
fluffy  O
.  O

Maybe  O
I  O
was  O
unfortunate  O
cause  O
I  O
did  O
not  O
manage  O
to  O
find  O
any  O
mushroom  O
in  O
my  O
omelette  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
also  O
not  O
as  O
cheesy  O
as  O
I  O
would  O
have  O
like  O
.  O

The  O
highlight  O
of  O
Signature  O
Stone  O
Restaurant  O
is  O
their  O
version  O
of  O
claypot  O
rice  O
using  O
stone  O
pot  O
.  O

To  O
suit  O
the  O
palate  O
of  O
the  O
younger  O
generation  O
,  O
the  O
restaurant  O
has  O
introduced  O
a  O
western  O
version  O
of  O
claypot  O
rice  O
such  O
as  O
Stone  O
Pot  O
Ham  O
&  O
Cheese  O
Rice  O
,  O
Stone  O
Pot  O
Lemony  O
Scallop  O
and  O
many  O
more  O
.  O

The  O
stone  O
pot  O
serving  O
is  O
for  O
bbbbbb  O
individual  O
portion  O
/bbbbbb  O
.  O

Upon  O
serving  O
,  O
the  O
server  O
will  O
drizzle  O
some  O
sweetened  O
dark  O
soy  O
sauce  O
over  O
the  O
rice  O
and  O
fold  O
it  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
prefer  O
your  O
rice  O
to  O
be  O
darker  O
,  O
you  O
can  O
add  O
more  O
of  O
the  O
sweetened  O
dark  O
soy  O
sauce  O
.  O

Stone  O
Pot  O
Garlic  O
Herb  O
Salmon  O
4.2/5  O

For  O
the  O
western  O
flavour  O
Stone  O
Pot  O
,  O
I  O
ordered  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Stone  O
Pot  O
Garlic  O
Herb  O
Salmon  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
12.30  O
)  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
a  O
good  O
choice  O
with  O
the  O
aroma  O
of  O
the  O
garlic  O
instantly  O
hit  O
the  O
nostrils  O
when  O
it  O
was  O
served  O
.  O

There  O
is  O
also  O
an  O
advantage  O
of  O
using  O
stone  O
pot  O
over  O
claypot  O
cause  O
you  O
get  O
layers  O
after  O
layers  O
of  O
burnt  O
crispy  O
rice  O
.  O

Why  O
so  O
?  O

The  O
first  O
fold  O
of  O
the  O
rice  O
brings  O
the  O
burnt  O
rice  O
to  O
the  O
top  O
.  O

While  O
eating  O
the  O
top  O
portion  O
of  O
the  O
rice  O
,  O
the  O
stone  O
pot  O
is  O
still  O
cooking  O
the  O
rice  O
at  O
the  O
bottom  O
.  O

Hence  O
when  O
we  O
fold  O
again  O
,  O
we  O
get  O
to  O
enjoy  O
another  O
layer  O
of  O
burnt  O
crispy  O
rice  O
.  O

Stone  O
Pot  O
Sliced  O
Pork  O
with  O
Salted  O
Fish  O
4/5  O

For  O
a  O
taste  O
of  O
tradition  O
,  O
I  O
tried  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Stone  O
Pot  O
Sliced  O
Pork  O
with  O
Salted  O
Fish  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
8.20  O
)  O
that  O
comes  O
with  O
sliced  O
pork  O
,  O
chinese  O
sausages  O
,  O
mushroom  O
and  O
salted  O
fish  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
the  O
fact  O
that  O
beside  O
the  O
salted  O
fish  O
in  O
the  O
stone  O
pot  O
,  O
it  O
also  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
separate  O
saucer  O
with  O
finely  O
diced  O
salted  O
fish  O
to  O
be  O
pour  O
and  O
mixed  O
with  O
the  O
rice  O
so  O
each  O
mouthful  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
good  O
blend  O
of  O
salted  O
fish  O
,  O
sweetened  O
dark  O
soy  O
sauce  O
and  O
rice  O
.  O

Overall  O
I  O
like  O
the  O
concept  O
of  O
Signature  O
Stone  O
Restaurant  O
.  O

However  O
for  O
an  O
individual  O
stone  O
pot  O
serving  O
portion  O
,  O
I  O
think  O
is  O
a  O
bit  O
pricey.Probably  O
they  O
can  O
provide  O
a  O
little  O
more  O
ingredients  O
for  O
the  O
stone  O
pot  O
so  O
that  O
it  O
gives  O
the  O
customer  O
an  O
impression  O
that  O
they  O
are  O
getting  O
value  O
in  O
return  O
.  O

Zensai  O
4/5  O

We  O
started  O
the  O
meal  O
with  O
a  O
trio  O
of  O
bbbbbb  O
Zensai  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
which  O
is  O
Japanese  O
for  O

.  O

Starting  O
with  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Shiraou  O
(  O
silver  O
fish  O
)  O
/bbbbbb  O
in  O
a  O
shoyu  O
sauce  O
,  O
I  O
like  O
how  O
it  O
was  O
presented  O
in  O
a  O
short  O
glass  O
.  O

The  O
shiraou  O
was  O
rather  O
fat  O
and  O
beautifully  O
balanced  O
with  O
the  O
flavourful  O
shoyu  O
sauce  O
.  O

Moving  O
on  O
we  O
have  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Oyster  O
in  O
Mayonnaise  O
/bbbbbb  O
.  O

While  O
I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
smoky  O
torched  O
mayonnaise  O
taste  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
too  O
overpowering  O
for  O
me  O
to  O
taste  O
the  O
oyster  O
.  O

Lastly  O
we  O
have  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Pitan  O
Tofu  O
/bbbbbb  O
which  O
is  O
one  O
of  O
my  O
all  O
time  O
favourites  O
in  O
Japanese  O
cuisine  O
.  O

While  O
century  O
egg  O
maybe  O
an  O
acquire  O
taste  O
for  O
some  O
,  O
I  O
simply  O
adored  O
the  O
combination  O
of  O
creamy  O
century  O
egg  O
paired  O
with  O
the  O
chilled  O
tofu  O
.  O

,  O
Salmon  O
,  O
Toro  O
Belly  O
and  O
Botan  O
Ebi  O

its  O

was  O
an  O

The  O

a  O
thin  O
sheet  O
of  O
crunchy  O
seaweed  O
and  O
plated  O
on  O
a  O

leaf  O
.  O

Amazingly  O
everything  O
on  O
the  O
plate  O
is  O
edible  O
.  O

As  O
the  O
dish  O
is  O
rather  O
oily  O
,  O
the  O
sakaru  O
leaf  O
helped  O
to  O
cleanse  O

Kamut  O
is  O
not  O
the  O

a  O

was  O

The  O
Amadel  O
Dark  O
Chocolate  O
Souffle  O
was  O
more  O
like  O
a  O
molten  O
lava  O
chocolate  O
cake  O
rather  O
than  O
a  O
souffle  O
.  O

The  O
accompanying  O
spicy  O
vanilla  O
ice  O
cream  O
on  O
the  O

was  O
rather  O
unique  O

creamy  O
and  O
smooth  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
tad  O
of  O
spiciness  O

Overall  O
the  O

that  O

Recently  O
I  O
have  O
been  O
going  O
to  O
The  O
Grandstand  O
and  O
I  O
always  O
noticed  O
a  O
crowd  O
at  O
the  O
Indian  O
restaurant  O
,  O
Curry  O
Garden  O
.  O

In  O
one  O
of  O
my  O
recent  O
visit  O
,  O
I  O
decided  O
to  O
check  O
it  O
out  O
since  O
the  O
restaurant  O
always  O
has  O
a  O
constant  O
flow  O
of  O
customers  O
.  O

Actually  O
I  O
was  O
quite  O
lost  O
in  O
what  O
to  O
order  O
so  O
I  O
just  O
went  O
to  O
the  O
set  O
menu  O
section  O
and  O
ordered  O
from  O
there  O
.  O

Mango  O
Lassi  O
4/5  O

While  O
waiting  O
for  O
my  O
meal  O
,  O
I  O
ordered  O
a  O
Mango  O
Lassi  O
to  O
start  O
with  O
.  O

Lassi  O
is  O
a  O
traditional  O
yogurt  O
based  O
drink  O
originating  O
from  O
India  O
.  O

The  O
mango  O
lassi  O
blended  O
with  O
yogurt  O
,  O
water  O
and  O
mango  O
pulp  O
was  O
cooling  O
,  O
soothing  O
and  O
perfect  O
compliment  O
for  O
the  O
spicy  O
food  O
.  O

Garlic  O

The  O
bbbbbb  O
Garlic  O
Naan  O
Chicken  O
Set  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
7.50  O
)  O
comes  O
with  O
2  O
pieces  O
of  O
garlic  O
naan  O
cut  O
into  O
4  O
pieces  O
,  O
curry  O
and  O
with  O
a  O
choice  O
of  O
butter  O
chicken  O
or  O
chicken  O
tikka  O
.  O

I  O
went  O
for  O
the  O
chicken  O
tikka  O
but  O
I  O
order  O
another  O
serving  O
of  O
mutton  O
masala  O
.  O

I  O
ca  O
n't  O
resist  O
ordering  O
the  O
mutton  O
masala  O
after  O
noticing  O
the  O
next  O
table  O
having  O
it  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O
tikka  O
was  O
too  O
dry  O
to  O
go  O
with  O
the  O
naan  O
,  O
mutton  O
masala  O
is  O
better  O
option  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
did  O
not  O
like  O
the  O
curry  O
as  O
it  O
was  O
served  O
cold  O
.  O

Batura  O
Set  O
Chicken  O

My  O

ordered  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Batura  O
Chicken  O
Set  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
6  O
)  O
with  O
butter  O
chicken  O
.  O

We  O
did  O
not  O
know  O
what  O
is  O
a  O
batura  O
and  O
we  O
were  O
surprised  O
to  O
see  O
the  O
huge  O
puffed  O
bread  O
made  O
from  O
maida  O
flour  O
when  O
it  O
was  O
served  O
.  O

We  O
are  O
also  O
surprised  O
that  O
the  O
butter  O
chicken  O
did  O
not  O
have  O
gravy  O
,  O
we  O
thought  O
they  O
have  O
served  O
us  O
chicken  O
tikka  O
instead  O
.  O

I  O
noticed  O
quite  O
a  O
few  O
patrons  O
ordered  O
their  O
curry  O
fish  O
head  O
,  O
I  O
should  O
try  O
to  O
have  O
them  O
in  O
my  O
next  O
visit  O
.  O

The  O
naan  O
is  O
pretty  O
good  O
too  O
but  O
I  O
will  O
prefer  O
the  O
mutton  O
masala  O
to  O
the  O
chicken  O
tikka  O
or  O

the  O

it  O

The  O

Tenderloin  O

was  O
probably  O
the  O
highlight  O
of  O
the  O
night  O
.  O

The  O
Australian  O
beef  O

was  O

another  O

the  O

was  O
a  O

of  O
a  O
disappointment  O
.  O

The  O

were  O
excellent  O
individually  O
.  O

However  O
the  O

was  O
overpowered  O
by  O
the  O

The  O
bbbbbb  O
Truffle  O

/bbbbbb  O
was  O

the  O

was  O
so  O

that  O
I  O

The  O

after  O
reading  O
the  O

finally  O
got  O
my  O
chance  O
to  O
make  O
my  O
way  O
down  O
to  O

to  O
check  O
out  O

4.2/5  O

Initially  O

I  O
was  O
n't  O
impressed  O
with  O
the  O
presentation  O
of  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O

/bbbbbb  O
(  O

when  O
it  O
was  O

I  O
was  O
looking  O
forward  O
to  O
a  O
beancurd  O
tower  O
instead  O
of  O
pieces  O
of  O
beancurd  O
drenched  O
with  O
the  O

.  O

What  O
hit  O
me  O
is  O
the  O
unique  O
savoury  O
sweet  O
peanut  O
sauce  O
that  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
hint  O
of  O
spiciness  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
probably  O
the  O
best  O
Tahu  O
Telor  O
sauce  O
I  O
ever  O
had  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
spotted  O
an  O
interesting  O
white  O
ingredient  O
garnished  O
on  O
top  O
of  O
the  O
beancurd  O
omelette  O
that  O
has  O
a  O
raw  O
garlic  O
taste  O
.  O

I  O
realised  O
it  O
was  O
baby  O
bean  O
sprout  O
head  O
which  O
they  O
painstakingly  O
peeled  O
after  O
checking  O
with  O
the  O

more  O
watered  O
down  O
with  O
a  O

I  O
am  O
actually  O
surprised  O
that  O
coconut  O

it  O

Nevertheless  O
the  O

Not  O

to  O

of  O
people  O

bbbbbb  O
AmaSoy  O
/bbbbbb  O
including  O
myself  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
only  O
introduced  O
to  O
it  O
during  O
one  O
of  O
my  O
visit  O
to  O
DARNO  O
Japanese  O
Hotpot  O
by  O
MOF  O
.  O

There  O
is  O
dual  O
meaning  O
to  O
the  O
brand  O
name  O
,  O
Ama  O
which  O
means  O
Sweet  O
in  O
Japanese  O
and  O
also  O
Grandma  O
in  O
Chinese  O
.  O

The  O
founder  O
chanced  O
upon  O
this  O
delicious  O
Tounyu  O
Soy  O
Beancurd  O
reminiscent  O
the  O
Singapore  O
soy  O
beancurd  O
during  O
her  O
stay  O
in  O
Japan  O
and  O
the  O
taste  O
reminded  O
her  O
of  O
the  O
memories  O
when  O
she  O
was  O
growing  O
up  O
with  O
her  O
grandma  O
in  O
meager  O
conditions  O
.  O

Let  O
me  O
let  O
you  O
in  O
to  O
something  O
you  O
probably  O
did  O
not  O
know  O
.  O

AmaSoy  O
beancurd  O
recipe  O
is  O
actually  O
a  O
Japanese  O
recipe  O
which  O
is  O
more  O
natural  O
compared  O
to  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
brands  O
that  O
uses  O
coffeemix  O
in  O
the  O
mixture  O
.  O

The  O
natural  O
and  O
nutritious  O
recipe  O
is  O
trans-fat  O
free  O
,  O
no  O
cholesterol  O
,  O
low  O
fat  O
content  O
,  O
lactose  O
free  O
,  O
no  O

and  O
100  O

.  O

Recently  O
,  O
AmaSoy  O
has  O
improved  O
in  O
their  O
recipes  O
enhancing  O
the  O
Japanese  O
pudding  O
with  O
bbbbbb  O
Collagen  O
/bbbbbb  O
and  O
bbbbbb  O
Omega  O
3  O
(  O

.  O

Besides  O
the  O
popular  O
Original  O
,  O
Almond  O
and  O
Mango  O
beancurd  O
,  O
exciting  O
new  O
flavours  O
and  O
toppings  O
are  O
introduced  O
.  O

More  O
choices  O
and  O
selections  O
now  O
.  O

New  O
flavours  O
include  O
bbbbbb  O
Matcha  O
/bbbbbb  O
and  O
bbbbbb  O
Salted  O
Caramel  O
/bbbbbb  O
.  O

For  O
toppings  O
,  O
one  O
can  O
look  O
forward  O
to  O
new  O
additions  O
such  O
as  O
red  O
bean  O
,  O
peanuts  O
,  O
gingko  O
nuts  O
,  O
lotus  O
seeds  O
,  O
aloe  O
vera  O
,  O
taro  O
and  O
strawberry  O
etc  O
.  O

So  O
why  O
do  O
I  O
prefer  O
AmaSoy  O
Japanese  O
pudding  O
or  O
beancurd  O
to  O
the  O
other  O
brand  O
?  O

First  O
of  O
all  O
,  O
I  O
find  O
the  O
other  O
brands  O
too  O
sweet  O
to  O
my  O
liking  O
.  O

AmaSoy  O
beancurd  O
is  O
not  O
too  O
sweet  O
and  O
nicely  O
balanced  O
in  O
texture  O
.  O

Have  O
you  O
ever  O
left  O
your  O
Lao  O
Ban  O
beancurd  O
overnight  O
and  O
noticed  O
a  O
sheet  O
like  O
layer  O
thingy  O
on  O
the  O
surface  O
?  O

I  O
felt  O
so  O
artificial  O
in  O
what  O
I  O
was  O
consuming  O
.  O

While  O
the  O
texture  O
of  O
Amasoy  O
may  O
not  O
be  O
as  O
smooth  O
compared  O
to  O
the  O
other  O
brands  O
,  O
the  O
health  O
conscious  O
me  O
prefer  O
the  O
all  O
natural  O
and  O
nutritious  O
recipe  O
.  O

Furthermore  O
,  O
it  O
now  O
comes  O
with  O
collagen  O
and  O
omega  O
3  O
(  O
DHA  O
)  O
.  O

Last  O
but  O
not  O
least  O
,  O
it  O
is  O
the  O
only  O
beancurd  O
brand  O
that  O
allows  O
one  O
to  O
add  O
toppings  O
of  O
their  O
liking  O
for  O
a  O
wholesome  O
enjoyment  O
of  O
this  O
delectable  O
dessert  O
.  O

With  O
the  O
new  O
revamped  O
recipe  O
and  O
menu  O
,  O
also  O
do  O
check  O

My  O

telling  O
about  O
this  O

at  O

was  O

in  O

quite  O

.  O

Some  O
on  O
a  O
Sunday  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
weeks  O
back  O
,  O
we  O
made  O
our  O

A  O
long  O

was  O
formed  O
at  O
the  O

and  O
we  O
have  O
to  O

The  O
bbbbbb  O
Sambal  O
Fish  O

/bbbbbb  O
(  O

is  O
the  O
reason  O
why  O
we  O
have  O
made  O
the  O
journey  O
to  O
the  O
far  O

.  O

This  O
fiery  O

packed  O
a  O

will  O
set  O

I  O
am  O
not  O
sure  O
what  O
species  O
of  O
fish  O
the  O
stall  O
used  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
firm  O
and  O
bouncy  O
.  O

The  O
sambal  O
was  O
definitely  O
the  O
highlight  O
cooked  O
with  O
the  O
delectable  O
fish  O
head  O
and  O
bitter  O

.  O

The  O
aroma  O
sambal  O
also  O
has  O
a  O
hint  O
of  O
Hua  O
Tiao  O
wine  O
making  O
it  O
more  O
fragrant  O
.  O

The  O

is  O

for  O
its  O

I  O
actually  O
wanted  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O
popular  O
Lor  O
Mee  O
at  O
Clementi  O

but  O
it  O
was  O

After  O
walking  O
around  O

From  O
my  O
observation  O
,  O
it  O
seems  O
like  O
this  O
is  O
a  O
family  O
run  O
stall  O
.  O

Besides  O
the  O
2  O
old  O
folks  O
that  O
is  O
helping  O
out  O
at  O
the  O
stall  O
which  O
I  O
suspect  O
is  O
the  O
parent  O
,  O
it  O
is  O
quite  O
hearten  O
to  O
see  O
2  O
young  O
gentlemen  O
probably  O
in  O
their  O
mid  O
20  O
to  O
early  O
30  O
years  O
of  O
age  O
running  O
the  O

is  O
at  O

has  O
a  O

to  O
it  O
.  O

The  O
sauce  O
and  O

was  O
quite  O
average  O

In  O
fact  O
I  O
found  O
the  O

was  O
rather  O
pathetic  O

/bbbbbb  O
(  O

much  O
better  O

with  O

allowing  O
the  O

its  O
delectable  O
pork  O

stands  O

with  O

While  O
I  O
find  O
the  O
wanton  O
noodle  O
rather  O
average  O
and  O
does  O
not  O
have  O
its  O
own  O
unique  O
character  O
,  O
it  O
is  O
interesting  O
to  O
know  O
that  O
Boon  O

has  O
always  O
been  O
able  O
to  O
attract  O
a  O
long  O

eager  O
to  O
try  O
their  O

The  O
culinary  O
scene  O
in  O
Singapore  O
has  O
been  O
buzzing  O
with  O
the  O
latest  O

Jamie  O

The  O
much  O
anticipated  O
Jamie  O

Italian  O
,  O
first  O
in  O
Asia  O
opened  O
its  O
door  O
on  O
17  O
July  O
2013  O
.  O

As  O
expected  O
,  O
long  O
queues  O
have  O
been  O
formed  O
every  O
day  O
since  O
the  O
opening  O
.  O

Although  O
the  O
restaurant  O
takes  O
reservation  O
,  O
only  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
tables  O
are  O
set  O
aside  O
each  O
day  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
wiser  O
to  O
join  O
the  O
queue  O
if  O
you  O
want  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
food  O
as  O
reservation  O
has  O
been  O
fully  O
booked  O
till  O
late  O
August  O
at  O
the  O
time  O
of  O
this  O

Jamie  O

is  O
headed  O
by  O
Executive  O

who  O
is  O

Baked  O
Mushroom  O
4/5  O

There  O
are  O
quite  O
a  O
number  O
of  O
antipasti  O
selections  O
from  O
the  O
menu  O
which  O
comes  O
in  O
planks  O
or  O
plates  O
.  O

We  O
tried  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Baked  O
Mushroom  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
12.50  O
)  O
,  O
the  O

bread  O
is  O
topped  O
with  O
sauteed  O
Swiss  O
brown  O
mushrooms  O
and  O
smoked  O
buffalo  O
mozzarella  O
.  O

A  O
delectable  O
antipasti  O
to  O
start  O
of  O
the  O
meal  O
.  O

Crispy  O
Squid  O
4/5  O

The  O
other  O
antipasti  O
we  O
tried  O
was  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Crispy  O
Squid  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
11.50  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
fried  O
squid  O
had  O
a  O
delightful  O
bite  O
to  O
it  O
,  O
fresh  O
and  O
crunchy  O
.  O

The  O
flavour  O
was  O
further  O
lifted  O
with  O
a  O
squeeze  O
of  O
the  O
lemon  O
zest  O
and  O
garlic  O
mayo  O
dip  O
.  O

However  O
the  O
portion  O
was  O
way  O
too  O
small  O
for  O
sharing  O
.  O

Black  O
Angel  O
Spaghetti  O
2.8/5  O

The  O
pasta  O
at  O
Jamie  O
's  O
Kitchen  O
is  O
made  O
freshly  O
on  O
site  O
everyday  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
actually  O
quite  O
interested  O
to  O
know  O
how  O
much  O
pasta  O
they  O
need  O
to  O
make  O
daily  O
since  O
most  O
customers  O
come  O
to  O
try  O
their  O
pasta  O
,  O
its  O
an  O
Italian  O
restaurant  O
after  O
all  O
.  O

Inevitably  O
,  O
we  O
ordered  O
some  O
pasta  O
dishes  O
to  O
try  O
which  O
comes  O
in  O
either  O
appertiser  O
or  O
main  O
course  O
portion  O
.  O

The  O
bbbbbb  O
Black  O
Angel  O
Spaghetti  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
16.00/  O
$  O
24.50  O
)  O
was  O
cooked  O
perfectly  O
al  O
dente  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
firm  O
bite  O
to  O
it  O
in  O
the  O
middle  O
.  O

The  O
squid  O
ink  O
pasta  O
was  O
served  O
with  O
scallops  O
,  O
garlic  O
,  O
chilli  O
,  O
anchovies  O
,  O
wine  O
and  O
capers  O
.  O

While  O
the  O
texture  O
was  O
good  O
,  O
I  O
did  O
not  O
quite  O
enjoy  O
the  O
dish  O
though  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
the  O
whole  O
execution  O
was  O
on  O
the  O
bland  O
side  O
.  O

Jool  O
's  O
Favourite  O
Sicilian  O

4/5  O

Another  O
pasta  O
dish  O
we  O
tried  O
was  O

tuna  O
slow  O
cooked  O
with  O

The  O
pleasing  O
spicy  O
tanginess  O
and  O
the  O
delightful  O
texture  O
of  O
the  O
Fusilli  O
made  O
it  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
better  O
dishes  O
we  O
tried  O
for  O
the  O
night  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
like  O
how  O
Jamie  O

Italian  O
served  O
the  O
herby  O
breadcrumb  O
on  O
the  O
spoon  O
for  O
their  O
pasta  O
and  O
risotto  O
dishes  O
.  O

The  O
breadcrumb  O
gave  O
the  O
dish  O
a  O
lift  O
in  O
texture  O

Topped  O
with  O

and  O

,  O
the  O
creamy  O

was  O
bursting  O
with  O
beautiful  O
flavours  O
.  O

While  O
flavours  O
we  O
incredibly  O
good  O
,  O
the  O
crab  O
meat  O
seemed  O
to  O
be  O
lost  O
in  O
the  O
sea  O
of  O
grains  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
prefer  O
more  O
chunky  O
crab  O
meats  O
for  O
the  O
price  O
I  O
am  O
paying  O
.  O

4.5/5  O

The  O
bbbbbb  O
Lamb  O
Chop  O
Lollipops  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
29.90  O
)  O
was  O
my  O
favourite  O
dish  O
for  O
the  O
night  O
.  O

The  O
bone-in  O
grilled  O
lamb  O
chops  O
were  O
served  O
with  O
a  O
creamy  O
artichoke  O
and  O
mint  O
sauce  O
,  O
roasted  O
nuts  O
,  O

and  O

The  O
lamb  O
was  O
tender  O

succulent  O
and  O
cooked  O
to  O
a  O
nice  O
pink  O
.  O

Ji  O
Warm  O
Brownie  O

For  O
dessert  O
,  O
we  O
have  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Ji  O
Warm  O
Brownie  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
11.50  O
)  O
which  O
was  O
made  O
from  O
mix  O
of  O
chocolate  O
,  O
raspberry  O
and  O
amaretto  O
served  O
with  O
a  O
scoop  O
of  O
vanilla  O
ice  O

.  O

The  O
brownie  O
was  O
really  O
moist  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
not  O
warm  O
.  O

Creamy  O
Panna  O

The  O
bbbbbb  O
Creamy  O
Panna  O
Cotta  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
9  O
)  O
is  O
probably  O
the  O
best  O
dessert  O
at  O
Jamie  O
's  O
Italian  O
.  O

Everyone  O
who  O
has  O
tried  O
it  O
has  O
recommended  O
it  O
.  O

The  O
wobbly  O
light  O
,  O
silky  O
and  O
smooth  O
panna  O
cotta  O
served  O
with  O
fruit  O
compote  O
was  O
a  O
memorable  O
dessert  O
to  O
end  O
the  O
night  O
on  O
a  O
sweet  O
note  O
.  O

Overall  O
,  O
Jamie  O
's  O
Italian  O
is  O
a  O
casual  O
restaurant  O
with  O
homely  O
Italian  O
food  O
.  O

The  O
price  O
for  O
homely  O
Italian  O
food  O
may  O
be  O
a  O
tad  O
expensive  O
but  O
considering  O
its  O
a  O
celebrity  O
chef  O
restaurant  O
it  O
is  O
quite  O
reasonable  O
priced  O
.  O

Judging  O
from  O
the  O
daily  O
queue  O
,  O
it  O
seems  O
like  O
customers  O
do  O
not  O
mind  O
the  O
price  O
.  O

Staffs  O
are  O
very  O
attentive  O
and  O
there  O
was  O
a  O
merry  O
and  O
relax  O
vibe  O
throughout  O
the  O

GRUB  O

latest  O

The  O

an  O

bbbbbb  O
Tasmanian  O
Mussels  O

Chorizo  O
Stew  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O

was  O
rather  O
a  O
disappointment  O
.  O

The  O
stew  O
was  O
watered  O
down  O
and  O
bland  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
have  O
preferred  O
a  O

of  O

the  O

were  O
fresh  O
and  O
fat  O
,  O
I  O
did  O
not  O
enjoy  O
the  O

The  O
pairing  O
was  O
kind  O
of  O
odd  O
for  O
me  O

bbbbbb  O
The  O
King  O
Louis  O
Grill  O
and  O
Bar  O
/bbbbbb  O
is  O
Singapore  O
first  O
medieval  O
restaurant  O
.  O

Tucked  O
in  O
a  O
corner  O
at  O
Vivocity  O
on  O
the  O
third  O
level  O
(  O
beside  O
Daiso  O

Teriyaki  O
Chicken  O
Salad  O
3.8/5  O

To  O
whet  O
up  O
our  O
appetite  O
for  O
the  O
banquet  O
feast  O
,  O
we  O
started  O
with  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Teriyaki  O
Chicken  O
Salad  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
13.80  O
)  O
that  O
comes  O
with  O
fresh  O
garden  O
salad  O
,  O
grilled  O
chicken  O
breast  O
meat  O
topped  O
with  O
teriyaki  O
sauce  O
and  O
parmesan  O
cheese  O
.  O

While  O
the  O
individual  O
components  O
stood  O
out  O
,  O
I  O
felt  O
that  O
the  O
teriyaki  O
sauce  O
was  O
too  O
much  O
masking  O
off  O
the  O
freshness  O
of  O
the  O
greens  O
.  O

Signature  O
Mushroom  O
Soup  O
3.5/5  O

The  O
homemade  O
bbbbbb  O
Signature  O
Mushroom  O
Soup  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
8.90  O
)  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
mix  O
of  O
button  O
and  O
shiitake  O
mushrooms  O
served  O
with  O
garlic  O
and  O
herbs  O
bread  O
.  O

The  O
creamy  O
mushroom  O
soup  O
was  O
comforting  O
and  O
hearty  O
.  O

The  O
serving  O
was  O
pretty  O
huge  O
too  O
.  O

While  O
I  O
found  O
it  O
a  O
tad  O
salty  O
the  O
rest  O
of  O
the  O
table  O
disagreed  O
with  O
me  O
.  O

Platter  O
C  O
3/5  O

When  O
you  O
have  O
a  O
group  O
of  O
diners  O
,  O
it  O
is  O
always  O
good  O
to  O
have  O
a  O
platter  O
for  O
sharing  O
before  O
the  O
mains  O
are  O
served  O
.  O

We  O
tried  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Platter  O
C  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
21.90  O
)  O
which  O
comes  O
with  O
chicken  O
drumlets  O
,  O
banana  O
bacon  O
bites  O
,  O
golden  O
calamari  O
,  O
prawn  O
twisters  O
and  O
crispy  O
wedges  O
.  O

Not  O
a  O
big  O
fan  O
of  O
fried  O
food  O
but  O
the  O
prawn  O
twister  O
was  O
pretty  O
good  O
.  O

The  O
drumlets  O
on  O
the  O
other  O
hand  O
was  O
dried  O
and  O
bland  O
.  O

The  O
banana  O
bacon  O
bites  O
was  O
interesting  O
but  O
did  O
not  O
have  O
the  O
wow  O
factor  O
.  O

The  O
menu  O
at  O
The  O
King  O

Grill  O
and  O

is  O
conceptualized  O
for  O
one  O
to  O
feast  O
like  O

and  O
hence  O
you  O
can  O
find  O
items  O

,  O
one  O
can  O
opt  O
for  O
meat  O

or  O
either  O
both  O
.  O

4/5  O

Among  O
all  O
the  O
premium  O
BBQ  O
baby  O
back  O
ribs  O
was  O
my  O
favourite  O
.  O

The  O
baby  O
back  O
ribs  O
was  O
tender  O
and  O
fell  O
off  O
the  O
bone  O
easily  O
.  O

The  O
roasted  O
beef  O
was  O
also  O
nicely  O
executed  O
,  O
tender  O
and  O
succulent  O
.  O

While  O
I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
scallop  O
,  O
the  O
snapper  O
and  O
prawn  O
was  O
not  O
as  O
good  O
compared  O
to  O
the  O
meat  O
.  O

The  O
snapper  O
was  O
dried  O
and  O
the  O
prawn  O
was  O
mushy  O
.  O

Overall  O
I  O
still  O
find  O
The  O
King  O

Grill  O

is  O
a  O
great  O
place  O
for  O

also  O

Back  O
in  O
March  O
2013  O
,  O
I  O
celebrated  O
my  O
birthday  O
by  O
booking  O
a  O
staycation  O
over  O
the  O
weekendat  O
the  O
newly  O
opened  O
PARKROYAL  O
on  O
Pickering  O
.  O

The  O
hotel  O
was  O
designed  O
by  O
local  O
award  O
winning  O
architectural  O
firm  O
Woha  O
,  O
creating  O
a  O
hotel  O
in  O
a  O
garden  O
design  O
.  O

I  O
would  O
recommend  O
the  O
hotel  O
to  O
tourist  O
because  O
of  O
its  O
excellent  O
location  O
that  O
is  O
accessible  O
and  O
a  O
stone  O
throw  O
away  O
to  O
many  O
interesting  O
places  O
in  O
Singapore  O
.  O

The  O
Chinatown  O
MRT  O
station  O
and  O
Clark  O
Quay  O
MRT  O
station  O
is  O
only  O
5  O
minutes  O
walk  O
away  O
.  O

Right  O
beside  O
the  O
hotel  O
is  O
Hong  O
Lim  O
Food  O
Centre  O
where  O
one  O
can  O
savour  O
the  O
local  O
delicacies  O
.  O

Chinatown  O
,  O
Clarke  O
Quay  O
and  O
Boat  O
Quay  O
are  O
also  O
within  O
walking  O
vicinity  O
from  O
the  O
hotel  O
.  O

Lime  O
is  O
the  O
only  O
restaurant  O
at  O
PARKROYAL  O
on  O
Pickering  O
with  O
floor  O
to  O
ceiling  O
glass  O
windows  O
and  O
three  O
open  O
kitchens  O
.  O

The  O
spacious  O
restaurant  O
has  O
a  O
friendly  O
and  O
welcoming  O
ambience  O
offering  O
a  O
diverse  O
selection  O
of  O
international  O
cuisines  O
and  O
Asian  O
flavours  O
.  O

My  O
room  O
was  O
on  O
the  O
tenth  O
floor  O
.  O

To  O
get  O
to  O
my  O
room  O
which  O
is  O
on  O
the  O
other  O
section  O
of  O
the  O
hotel  O
,  O
I  O
need  O
to  O
walk  O
through  O
this  O
outdoor  O
corridor  O
.  O

With  O
a  O
closer  O
look  O
,  O
I  O
realised  O
the  O
right  O
of  O
the  O
corridor  O
are  O
exactly  O
hotel  O
rooms  O
with  O
greenery  O
wall  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
the  O
corridor  O
indoor  O
leading  O
to  O
my  O
hotel  O
room  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
the  O
Superior  O
King  O
room  O
which  O
I  O
have  O
booked  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
the  O
floor  O
to  O
ceiling  O
window  O
design  O
allowing  O
the  O
natural  O
light  O
to  O
light  O
up  O
the  O
room  O
giving  O
it  O
a  O
very  O
welcoming  O
ambience  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
how  O
the  O
hotel  O
creatively  O
uses  O
partition  O
for  O
the  O
room  O
.  O

Noticed  O
the  O
mirror  O
section  O
of  O
the  O
room  O
?  O

It  O
is  O
actually  O
a  O
sliding  O
partition  O
.  O

Behind  O
the  O
sliding  O
partition  O
is  O
the  O
toilet  O
and  O
shower  O
room  O
.  O

The  O
toiletries  O
are  O
pretty  O
standard  O
.  O

Beside  O
the  O
comfort  O
king  O
size  O
bed  O
,  O
I  O
like  O
the  O
bay  O
window  O
area  O
with  O
the  O
floor  O
to  O
ceiling  O
windows  O
alot  O
.  O

I  O
applauded  O
the  O
interior  O
deisgner  O
who  O
creatively  O
made  O
used  O
of  O
the  O
bay  O
window  O
area  O
to  O
create  O
a  O
sitting  O
area  O
.  O

There  O
is  O
also  O
a  O
table  O
area  O
at  O
the  O
bay  O
window  O
beside  O
where  O
the  O
beverages  O
are  O
stored  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
that  O
is  O
a  O
very  O
thoughtful  O
design  O
making  O
use  O
of  O
the  O
bay  O
window  O
area  O
again  O
.  O

The  O
work  O
desk  O
is  O
quite  O
spacious  O
and  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
very  O
comfort  O
seat  O
.  O

My  O
booking  O
came  O
with  O
a  O
complimentary  O
access  O
to  O
the  O
rooftop  O
Orchid  O
Club  O
Lounge  O
.  O

The  O
lounge  O
offers  O
a  O
spectacular  O
360  O
degree  O
views  O
of  O
the  O
Singapore  O
city  O
skyline  O
.  O

Spent  O
sometime  O
at  O
the  O
Orchid  O
Club  O
Lounge  O
for  O
some  O
high  O
tea  O
before  O
I  O
proceed  O
on  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O
rest  O
of  O
the  O
hotels  O
.  O

The  O
infinity  O
pool  O
on  O
the  O
5th  O
floor  O
of  O
the  O
hotel  O
is  O
a  O
bit  O
small  O
but  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
view  O
looking  O
across  O
Hong  O
Lim  O
Park  O
.  O

What  O
caught  O
my  O
attention  O
is  O
the  O
bird  O
cage  O
like  O
structure  O
which  O
is  O
actually  O
oversized  O
cabanas  O
designed  O
to  O
resemble  O
flowers  O
about  O
to  O
bloom  O
amongst  O
the  O
foliage  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
enjoyed  O
my  O
staycation  O
at  O
PARKROYAL  O
on  O
Pickering  O
and  O
I  O
highly  O
recommend  O
this  O
place  O
for  O
tourists  O
if  O
you  O
are  O
not  O
on  O

Ayam  O
Penyet  O
President  O
is  O
the  O
new  O
resident  O
at  O
Serangoon  O
NEX  O
servicing  O
authentic  O
Indonesian  O
cuisine  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
to  O
admit  O
I  O
was  O
looking  O
for  O
an  O
experience  O
and  O
meal  O
that  O
is  O
fit  O
for  O
a  O
president  O
.  O

Unfortunately  O
,  O
I  O
am  O
brought  O
to  O
reality  O
very  O
soon  O
when  O
I  O
needed  O
to  O
walk  O
up  O
to  O
the  O
cashier  O
to  O
place  O
my  O
order  O
and  O
made  O
payment  O
before  O
I  O
got  O
my  O
food  O
served  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
not  O
how  O
you  O
treat  O
a  O
president  O
or  O
rather  O
I  O
thought  O
I  O
will  O
be  O
treated  O
like  O
a  O
president  O
.  O

Tahu  O
Telor  O
2/5  O

The  O
bbbbbb  O
Tahu  O
Telor  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
5.50  O
)  O
was  O
a  O
big  O
disappointment  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
expecting  O
a  O
tall  O
standing  O
tower  O
of  O
the  O
tahu  O
telor  O
but  O
instead  O
I  O
was  O
served  O
with  O
with  O
pieces  O
of  O
fried  O
beancurd  O
wrapped  O
in  O
by  O
a  O
omelette  O
.  O

I  O
really  O
felt  O
I  O
was  O
being  O
cheated  O
.  O

Ayam  O
Penyet  O
3/5  O

The  O
bbbbbb  O
Ayam  O
Penyet  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
6.50  O
)  O
is  O
a  O
Malay  O
word  O
which  O
literally  O
means  O
smashed  O
fried  O
chicke  O
does  O
not  O
come  O
with  O
steamed  O
rice  O
.  O

The  O
Steamed  O
Rice  O
(  O
$  O
0.80  O
)  O
needs  O
to  O
be  O
order  O
separately  O
.  O

While  O
the  O
chicken  O
was  O
tender  O
and  O
moist  O
,  O
the  O
chicken  O
was  O
not  O
flatted  O
or  O
smashed  O
enough  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
wished  O
I  O
could  O
have  O
more  O
of  O
the  O
crispy  O
bits  O
.  O

Ayam  O
Bakar  O
3.5/5  O

I  O
also  O
tried  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Ayam  O
Bakar  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
6.50  O
)  O
which  O
is  O
served  O
with  O
grilled  O
tofu  O
,  O
bean  O
cake  O
and  O
cut  O
chilli  O
in  O
black  O
sauce  O
.  O

Actually  O
the  O
waitress  O
left  O
out  O
the  O
cut  O
chilii  O
in  O
black  O
sauce  O
and  O
I  O
have  O
asked  O
for  O
it  O
.  O

The  O
grilled  O
chicken  O
with  O
the  O
sweet  O
sauce  O
drenched  O
over  O
it  O
was  O
rather  O
flavourful  O
.  O

It  O
complemented  O
the  O
moist  O
and  O
tender  O
chicken  O
.  O

Mixed  O
Fruit  O
Juice  O
a  O

The  O
meal  O
ended  O
on  O
a  O
sweet  O
note  O
with  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Mixed  O
Fruit  O
Juice  O
a  O

/bbbbbb  O
(  O

)  O
and  O
bbbbbb  O
Ice  O
Chendol  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
3  O
)  O
.  O

The  O
mixed  O
fruit  O
juice  O
a  O
la  O
president  O
is  O
quite  O
similar  O
to  O
our  O
Chinese  O
version  O
of  O
Ice  O
Kachang  O
.  O

Overall  O
I  O
find  O
that  O
the  O
food  O
here  O
is  O
just  O
average  O
and  O
definitely  O
you  O
wo  O
n't  O
be  O
getting  O
the  O
president  O
treatment  O
.  O

Unless  O
I  O
need  O
a  O
quick  O
meal  O
or  O
avoid  O
the  O
crowd  O
,  O
I  O
probably  O
would  O
not  O
visit  O
the  O
eatery  O

After  O

I  O

for  O

of  O

So  O
how  O
did  O
I  O
find  O
the  O
nostalgic  O
flavour  O
of  O
1960s  O
?  O

While  O
the  O
duck  O
meat  O
was  O
flavourful  O
but  O
I  O
felt  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
tad  O
dry  O
.  O

The  O
kway  O
teow  O
texture  O
was  O
a  O
a  O
bit  O
too  O
thick  O
and  O
not  O
as  O
smooth  O
as  O
I  O
would  O
like  O
.  O

Overall  O
it  O
was  O
still  O
a  O
decent  O
bowl  O
of  O
duck  O
noodle  O
that  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
rustic  O
taste  O
that  O
probably  O
will  O
bring  O
back  O
childhood  O
memories  O
for  O

a  O
simple  O

served  O
with  O
sliced  O

with  O
a  O
bowl  O

An  O
interesting  O
name  O
but  O
I  O
find  O
it  O
hard  O
to  O
associate  O
the  O
name  O
to  O
the  O
dish  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
a  O
dish  O
I  O
probably  O
would  O
skip  O

spend  O
my  O

on  O

The  O

was  O
nicely  O
balanced  O
with  O
the  O

I  O
only  O
hope  O
that  O
I  O
was  O

portion  O

I  O
will  O
be  O
glad  O
to  O

My  O
first  O
introduction  O
to  O
Shio-koji  O
(  O
salted  O
rice  O

)  O
is  O
at  O
Japanese  O
Dining  O
SUNat  O
Chijmes  O
hence  O
I  O
am  O
not  O
foreign  O
to  O
it  O
.  O

I  O
still  O
remembered  O
I  O
was  O
served  O
a  O
platter  O
of  O
shiokoji  O
marinated  O
ingredients  O
and  O
how  O
it  O
enhanced  O
the  O
flavours  O
.  O

The  O
bbbbbb  O

/bbbbbb  O
(  O

tossed  O
with  O

extra  O
virgin  O
oil  O
,  O
avocado  O
and  O
ginger  O
flower  O
worked  O
harmoniously  O
together  O
.  O

The  O
Japanese  O
octopus  O
also  O
had  O
a  O
nice  O
crunchy  O
and  O
chewy  O
texture  O
which  O
was  O
very  O
enjoyable  O
.  O

definitely  O
worthy  O

to  O
try  O
at  O

is  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Umami  O
Prawn  O
Capellini  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O

.  O

The  O

is  O
served  O
with  O
grilled  O
prawns  O
,  O
homemade  O
crustacean  O
oil  O
,  O
topped  O
with  O
bonito  O
flakes  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
told  O
that  O
they  O
used  O
a  O
cooking  O
technique  O
that  O
they  O
learnt  O
from  O
fried  O
hokkien  O
mee  O
to  O
infuse  O
all  O
the  O
wonderful  O
flavours  O
together  O

All  O

are  O
made  O
with  O

The  O
whimsical  O
named  O
bbbbbb  O
OMG  O
Burger  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O

with  O

sandwiched  O
between  O
2  O
soft  O
sesame  O
brioche  O
buns  O
and  O
served  O
with  O
fries  O
and  O
salad  O
.  O

Although  O
the  O
luncheon  O
meat  O
gives  O
the  O
local  O
palate  O
the  O
extra  O
texture  O
and  O
bite  O
to  O
it  O
,  O
it  O
lacked  O
that  O
bursting  O
juiciness  O
of  O
a  O
burger  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
a  O
good  O
burger  O
but  O
I  O
do  O
n't  O
think  O
it  O
is  O
the  O
best  O

Desserts  O
for  O
me  O
was  O
rather  O
average  O
for  O
a  O
cafe  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
lacking  O
the  O
excitement  O
compared  O
to  O
their  O
whimsical  O
appertisers  O
and  O
mains  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
felt  O
it  O
is  O
overpriced  O
for  O
what  O
is  O
being  O
put  O
on  O
the  O
plate  O
.  O

However  O
I  O
do  O
understand  O
that  O
they  O
will  O
be  O
having  O
a  O
bigger  O
pastry  O
kitchen  O
and  O
coming  O
up  O
with  O
more  O
delectable  O
desserts  O
on  O
the  O

I  O
look  O
forward  O
in  O
going  O
back  O
not  O
only  O
for  O
the  O
mains  O
and  O

but  O
their  O

with  O
an  O

thick  O

robust  O
curry  O
gravy  O
.  O

The  O
gravy  O
tasted  O
nothing  O
near  O
the  O
Indian  O
or  O
Malay  O
curry  O
.  O

It  O
has  O
its  O
own  O
characteristic  O

the  O

from  O
an  O
over  O
40  O

You  O

it  O

the  O

brings  O
the  O

it  O
actually  O
works  O
in  O
a  O
wonderfully  O

The  O
greasy  O

was  O
so  O
addictive  O
that  O
I  O
just  O
ca  O
n't  O
stop  O
until  O
I  O
emptied  O
the  O

While  O
the  O
red  O

was  O
good  O
especially  O
after  O
a  O
spicy  O
feast  O
to  O
cool  O
off  O

,  O
it  O
was  O
the  O
mango  O

that  O

It  O
instantly  O
brought  O
back  O

I  O
frequent  O

with  O
a  O

of  O

The  O
design  O
of  O
the  O
buffet  O
spread  O
area  O
is  O
quite  O
interesting  O
with  O
cold  O
air  O

out  O
from  O
the  O

keeping  O
the  O
raw  O

fresh  O

The  O
signature  O
items  O
at  O
Shabu  O

are  O
the  O
pork  O
,  O
beef  O
and  O

is  O

we  O
managed  O
to  O
try  O
all  O

they  O
were  O
all  O
disappointing  O
.  O

They  O
were  O
either  O
too  O

It  O
is  O
really  O
a  O

that  O

the  O
skin  O
of  O

stuffed  O
with  O
the  O

This  O

takes  O
more  O
than  O
10  O

a  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
the  O
promfret  O
was  O
beautifully  O
cooked  O
,  O
fresh  O
and  O
moist  O
.  O

However  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
small  O
to  O
be  O
shared  O
for  O
a  O

of  O
11  O

was  O
one  O
of  O
the  O

I  O
tried  O
.  O

The  O
beehoon  O
was  O
also  O
smooth  O
and  O
firm  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
so  O
slippery  O
that  O
we  O
had  O
a  O
hard  O
time  O
holding  O
them  O
on  O

The  O

The  O

a  O

small  O
for  O

if  O

The  O
best  O
way  O

is  O
a  O
bit  O
different  O
from  O
the  O
norm  O
.  O

The  O
black  O
pepper  O
sauce  O
is  O
wetter  O
compared  O
to  O
the  O
usually  O
dry  O
version  O
.  O

It  O
tasted  O

those  O

on  O

.  O

This  O
is  O
really  O
an  O

may  O
not  O
be  O
for  O

If  O
given  O
a  O
choice  O

I  O

still  O
prefer  O
the  O

special  O
and  O

.  O

You  O
probably  O
ca  O
n't  O
find  O
it  O

The  O
best  O
way  O
to  O

to  O
dip  O
it  O
into  O

up  O

was  O

to  O
get  O
a  O

as  O
I  O
did  O

It  O
is  O
a  O
Japanese  O
styled  O
patisserie  O
serving  O
authentic  O
Japanese  O

French  O
pastry  O
.  O

Chef  O
Yamashita  O
brings  O
with  O
him  O
over  O
20  O
years  O
of  O
baking  O
techniques  O
to  O
Singapore  O
and  O
spent  O
a  O

and  O
a  O
half  O
tailoring  O
his  O
signature  O
cakes  O
to  O
suit  O
the  O
climate  O
and  O

palate  O

I  O
got  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O

/bbbbbb  O
(  O
17x12  O
for  O
bbbbbb  O
/bbbbbb  O
$  O

)  O
which  O
is  O
a  O
soft  O
sponge  O
that  O
is  O
made  O
traditionally  O
without  O
baking  O
powder  O
nor  O
any  O
chemical  O
raising  O
agent  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
filled  O
with  O
fresh  O
strawberries  O
and  O
luscious  O
cream  O
topped  O
with  O
summer  O
berries  O
and  O
fresh  O
fruits  O
.  O

I  O
dislike  O
cakes  O
that  O
are  O
dry  O
,  O
sweet  O
and  O
that  O
comes  O
with  O
too  O
much  O
cream  O
.  O

The  O
Berry  O
Berries  O
cake  O
was  O
totally  O
the  O
opposite  O
.  O

The  O
flavours  O
were  O
well  O
harmonized  O
.  O

The  O
cake  O
was  O
very  O
soft  O
and  O
moist  O
.  O

The  O
price  O
is  O
also  O
very  O
reasonable  O
.  O

As  O
the  O

at  O
Flor  O
Patisserie  O
is  O
made  O
entirely  O
of  O
natural  O
and  O
fresh  O
ingredients  O
,  O
they  O
do  O
not  O
keep  O
well  O
.  O

Hence  O
it  O
is  O
best  O
to  O
be  O
consumed  O
on  O
the  O

itself  O

Flor  O

The  O

spent  O

studying  O
in  O

Platter  O

The  O
Cold  O
Cut  O
Platter  O
(  O

)  O
comes  O
with  O
3  O
types  O
of  O
cold  O
cuts  O
served  O
with  O
silver  O
onions  O
,  O
gherkins  O
,  O
scotch  O
eggs  O
and  O
homemade  O
bread  O
.  O

Scotch  O
Eggs  O
are  O
a  O
first  O
for  O
me  O
.  O

I  O
did  O
n't  O
know  O
eggs  O
can  O
be  O
wrapped  O
in  O
sausage  O
meat  O
,  O
coated  O
in  O
breadcrumbs  O
and  O
deep  O
fried  O
.  O

Love  O
that  O
the  O
yolkwas  O
still  O
runny  O
and  O
it  O
came  O
with  O
different  O
textures  O
of  O
enjoyment  O
.  O

Smoked  O
Tomato  O
Soup  O
4.5/5  O

This  O
is  O
probably  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
best  O
tomato  O
soup  O
I  O
ever  O
had  O
.  O

The  O
Smoked  O
Tomato  O
Soup  O
(  O

drizzled  O
with  O
peso  O
was  O
velvety  O
,  O
hearty  O
andcomforting  O
.  O

Strawberry  O
Spinach  O
Salad  O
4.5/5  O

The  O
Strawberry  O
Spinach  O
Salad  O
(  O
$  O
18  O
)  O
sounds  O
a  O
bit  O
bizarre  O
with  O
the  O
medley  O
of  O
crumbled  O
blue  O
cheese  O
,  O
pistachios  O
,  O
bacon  O
and  O
avocado  O
drizzled  O
with  O
raspberry  O
vinaigrette  O
was  O
surprisingly  O
very  O
good  O
and  O
well  O
balanced  O
.  O

Many  O
people  O
do  O
not  O
like  O
the  O
acquire  O
taste  O
of  O
blue  O
cheese  O
but  O
the  O
one  O
used  O
at  O
The  O
Ascot  O
is  O
rather  O
mild  O
and  O
it  O
is  O
quite  O
easy  O
for  O
the  O
local  O
palate  O
.  O

A  O

Bangers  O

Sausages  O
(  O
veal  O
,  O
kurobuta  O
pork  O
,  O
pork  O
&  O
garlic  O
)  O
and  O
served  O
on  O
traditional  O
English  O
dish  O
made  O
with  O
shallow  O
fried  O
leftover  O
vegetables  O
known  O
as  O
Bubble  O
and  O
Squeak  O
.  O

It  O
got  O
its  O
name  O
because  O
of  O
the  O
bubbling  O
and  O
squeaking  O
sounds  O
during  O
cooking  O
.  O

The  O
best  O

to  O
compliment  O
the  O

is  O
none  O
other  O
than  O
having  O
an  O

it  O
looked  O

was  O

I  O
sunk  O
my  O

into  O
the  O
soft  O
Turkish  O
bread  O
sandwiched  O
withbeautifully  O
cooked  O
fish  O
that  O
was  O

also  O
had  O
a  O
nice  O

of  O

until  O
today.Since  O
I  O
do  O

I  O
was  O
afraid  O
thatthe  O
deep  O

be  O
too  O
sweet  O
for  O
my  O
liking  O
.  O

It  O
turned  O
out  O
that  O
it  O
was  O
acceptable  O
for  O
my  O
palate  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
not  O
too  O
sweet  O
and  O
had  O
a  O
nice  O
thinbatter  O
coatingwhich  O
helps  O
to  O
tone  O
down  O
the  O
sweetness  O
as  O
well  O
as  O

Chicken  O
3.5/5  O

It  O
is  O
understand  O
that  O
Ipoh  O
Lou  O
Yau  O
Bean  O
Sprouts  O
Chicken  O
uses  O
only  O
free  O
range  O
kampong  O
chicken  O
imported  O
from  O
Malaysia  O
.  O

I  O
ordered  O
the  O
Kampong  O
Chicken  O
(  O
$  O
9.50  O
for  O
2  O
pax  O
)  O
and  O
2  O
plates  O
of  O
chicken  O
rice  O
separately  O
for  O
$  O
2.40  O
.  O

The  O
chicken  O
has  O
a  O
more  O
intense  O
yellow  O
skinned  O
colour  O
compare  O
to  O
those  O
we  O
commonly  O
had  O
.  O

Besides  O
that  O
there  O
is  O
nothing  O
special  O
about  O
the  O
chicken  O
.  O

I  O
also  O
find  O
the  O
serving  O
a  O
bit  O
stingy  O
with  O
the  O
pricing  O
for  O
2  O

Blanched  O
and  O
bathed  O
in  O
a  O
savoury  O
sauce  O
,  O
the  O
bean  O

were  O
definitely  O
sweeter  O

Pork  O
Ball  O
Soup  O
3/5  O

I  O
realized  O
that  O
the  O
eatery  O
does  O
not  O
serve  O
soup  O
for  O
my  O
chicken  O
rice  O
,  O
so  O
I  O
separately  O
ordered  O
a  O
bowl  O
of  O
Pork  O
Ball  O
Soup  O
(  O
$  O
5  O

.  O

The  O
pork  O
ball  O
was  O
rather  O
decent  O
and  O
bouncy  O
.  O

Overall  O
I  O
am  O
quite  O
disappointed  O
with  O

I  O
still  O
prefer  O
my  O

and  O
cheaper  O
Hainanese  O
chicken  O
rice  O
from  O

After  O
doing  O
some  O
research  O
online  O
,  O
I  O
got  O
to  O
know  O
that  O
the  O
stall  O
has  O
moved  O
to  O
Telok  O
Blangah  O
Crescent  O
Market  O

So  O
with  O
my  O

and  O
empty  O
stomach  O
,  O
Iheaded  O
downto  O

Many  O
memories  O
came  O
back  O
to  O
me  O
when  O
I  O
dig  O
in  O
to  O
the  O
delicious  O
plate  O
of  O
bbbbbb  O
Char  O

(  O

.  O

I  O
remembered  O
the  O
uncle  O
used  O
to  O
run  O
the  O
stall  O
alone  O
but  O
now  O
he  O
has  O
a  O
helper  O
helping  O
him  O
.  O

If  O
I  O
am  O
not  O
wrong  O
,  O
the  O
uncle  O
should  O
be  O
65  O
years  O
old  O
this  O
year  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
still  O
good  O
to  O
see  O
him  O
going  O
strong  O
and  O
frying  O
each  O
plate  O
individually  O
.  O

The  O
plate  O
of  O
char  O
kway  O
teow  O
is  O
neither  O
too  O
wet  O
or  O
dry  O
,  O
for  O
my  O
standard  O
it  O
is  O
rather  O
perfect  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
are  O
a  O

of  O

,  O
you  O
will  O

It  O

Although  O
the  O
plate  O
of  O
char  O
kway  O

does  O
not  O
come  O
with  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
ingredients  O
such  O
as  O
fish  O

and  O
chinese  O

I  O

There  O
are  O
quite  O
a  O
few  O
Famous  O

Trishaw  O
Laksa  O
stalls  O
around  O
the  O
island  O
which  O
I  O
think  O
are  O
franchised  O
.  O

The  O
original  O
stall  O
is  O
at  O
Jalan  O

and  O
it  O
is  O
still  O
using  O
charcoal  O
to  O
cook  O
its  O

The  O
owner  O
of  O
this  O

Mr  O
Daniel  O

has  O
been  O
running  O
this  O

In  O

of  O

,  O
there  O
were  O
luxurious  O
servicing  O
of  O

I  O
was  O
totally  O
blown  O
off  O

the  O

the  O
spicy  O

sweet  O
and  O
sour  O

The  O
gravy  O
comes  O
with  O
a  O
lighter  O
colour  O
,  O
smoother  O
texture  O
and  O
it  O
is  O
less  O

In  O
short  O
it  O
seems  O
like  O
a  O
more  O
healthy  O
version  O
but  O
not  O
compromising  O
in  O
taste  O

In  O

Before  O
leaving  O

I  O
tried  O
my  O
luck  O
to  O
check  O
with  O
the  O
uncle  O
what  O
fruits  O
were  O
added  O
to  O
gravy  O
but  O
he  O
refuses  O
to  O
tell  O
me  O
the  O
ingredients  O
.  O

He  O
only  O
tells  O
me  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
work  O
is  O
needed  O
to  O
prepare  O
the  O
gravy  O
and  O
it  O
needs  O
to  O
be  O
boiled  O
by  O
a  O
good  O
2  O
hours  O
.  O

I  O
suspect  O
pineapple  O
and  O
lime  O
were  O
added  O
.  O

If  O
you  O
have  O
the  O
chance  O
to  O
visit  O

do  O
check  O

bbbbbb  O
Chef  O
Kim  O

/bbbbbb  O
from  O
Lotte  O
World  O
to  O
present  O
bbbbbb  O
A  O
Taste  O
of  O
Korea  O
/bbbbbb  O
as  O
part  O
of  O
its  O
International  O
buffet  O
.  O

There  O
are  O
already  O
quite  O
a  O
number  O
of  O
Korean  O
restaurants  O
in  O
Singapore  O
and  O
most  O
of  O
us  O
are  O
rather  O
familiar  O
with  O
Korean  O
cuisine  O
.  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
it  O
is  O
still  O
worthwhile  O
to  O
visit  O
Straits  O
Cafe  O
for  O
their  O
buffet  O
as  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
Korean  O
dishes  O
prepared  O
by  O
Chef  O
Kim  O
Hyun  O
Jung  O
is  O
not  O
commonly  O
served  O
in  O
local  O
Korean  O
restaurant  O
.  O

Banchan  O

Banchan  O
(  O
side  O
dishes  O
)  O
is  O
like  O
astaple  O
of  O
Korean  O
cuisine  O
.  O

At  O
A  O
Taste  O
of  O
Korea  O
buffet  O
,  O
the  O
spread  O
also  O
offers  O
some  O
side  O
dishes  O
such  O
as  O
bbbbbb  O
Zucchini  O
,  O
Bean  O
Sprouts  O
,  O
Kimchi  O
/bbbbbb  O
and  O
bbbbbb  O
Vermicelli  O
/bbbbbb  O
.  O

My  O
favourite  O
among  O
the  O
side  O
dishes  O
is  O
the  O
kimchi  O
.  O

Korean  O
Ginseng  O
Soup  O
4/5  O

This  O
is  O
quite  O
interesting  O
for  O
my  O
limited  O
knowledge  O
of  O
Korean  O
cuisine  O
.  O

The  O
bbbbbb  O
Korean  O
Ginseng  O
Soup  O
/bbbbbb  O
exactly  O
has  O
rice  O
in  O
it  O
and  O
it  O
felt  O
like  O
having  O
a  O
bowl  O
of  O
porridge  O
instead  O
of  O
a  O
bowl  O
of  O
soup  O
.  O

The  O
hearty  O
bowl  O
of  O
Korean  O
Ginseng  O
Soup  O
was  O
very  O
comforting  O
with  O
ingredients  O
such  O
as  O
chicken  O
,  O
water  O
chestnut  O
and  O
ginseng  O
.  O

One  O
can  O
also  O
add  O
a  O
pinch  O
of  O
sea  O
salt  O
to  O
enhance  O
the  O
flavour  O
further  O
.  O

Seabass  O
and  O
Zucchini  O
Pancakes  O
3.5/4  O

I  O
quite  O
enjoy  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Seabass  O
and  O
Zucchini  O
Pancakes  O
/bbbbbb  O
which  O
has  O
a  O
nice  O
thin  O
coat  O
of  O
flour  O
and  O
egg  O
batter  O
.  O

Itwas  O
rather  O
bland  O
if  O
eaten  O
without  O
sauces  O
.  O

The  O
star  O
was  O
the  O
dipping  O
soy  O
sauce  O
that  O
made  O
the  O
pancakes  O
shone  O
,  O
accentuating  O
the  O
flavour  O
and  O
dimension  O
of  O
the  O
dish  O
.  O

Hot  O
Spicy  O
Chicken  O
3/5  O

Resembling  O
our  O
local  O
curry  O
chicken  O
,  O
the  O
Korean  O
version  O
of  O
bbbbbb  O
Hot  O
Spicy  O
Chicken  O
/bbbbbb  O
was  O
rather  O
mild  O
and  O
fiery  O
free  O
to  O
the  O
local  O
palate  O
.  O

Beef  O
Ribs  O
4.2/5  O

The  O
thinly  O
sliced  O
prime  O
bbbbbb  O
Beef  O
Ribs  O
/bbbbbb  O
was  O
beautiful  O
marinated  O
and  O
grilled  O
to  O
perfection  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
succulent  O
and  O
tender  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
thin  O
layer  O
of  O
fats  O
.  O

Probably  O
the  O
favourite  O
among  O
the  O
diners  O
as  O
I  O
noticed  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
us  O
went  O
for  O
more  O
helpings  O
of  O
the  O
beef  O

the  O
bbbbbb  O
Honey  O
Citron  O

/bbbbbb  O
was  O

it  O

Fish  O
Head  O
Steamboat  O
4.5/5  O

My  O
all  O

place  O
is  O
at  O
bbbbbb  O
Nam  O
Hwa  O
Chong  O
(  O
Ah  O
Chew  O
)  O
Fish  O
Head  O
Steamboat  O
Corner  O
(  O
)  O
/bbbbbb  O
at  O
the  O
corner  O
of  O
Jalan  O
Sultan  O
and  O
North  O
Bridge  O
Road  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
probably  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
oldest  O
restaurant  O
in  O
Singapore  O
since  O
1927  O
/bbbbbb  O
.  O

It  O
is  O
said  O
by  O
many  O
that  O
they  O
are  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
creator  O
of  O
the  O
Teochew  O
Fish  O
Head  O
Steamboat  O
/bbbbbb  O
.  O

Now  O
run  O
by  O
the  O
3rd  O
generation  O
,  O
the  O
restaurant  O
still  O
continues  O
to  O
use  O
charcoal  O
for  O
their  O
traditional  O
Teochew  O
Fish  O
Head  O
Steamboat  O
that  O
comes  O
with  O
slurp  O
worthy  O
rich  O
and  O
sweet  O
tastes  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
fish  O
,  O
grouper  O
and  O
promfret  O
are  O
more  O
popular  O
with  O
the  O
patrons  O
.  O

Oyster  O
Omelette  O
3/5  O

Beside  O
Fish  O
Head  O
Steamboat  O
,  O
the  O
restaurant  O
also  O
serves  O
some  O
delectable  O
Zi  O
Char  O
dishes  O
.  O

The  O
bbbbbb  O
Oyster  O
Omelette  O
/bbbbbb  O
was  O
rather  O
pedestrian  O
.  O

The  O
oysters  O
were  O
also  O
rather  O
small  O
.  O

Prawn  O
Paste  O
Chicken  O
Wings  O
3/5  O

The  O
bbbbbb  O
Prawn  O
Paste  O
Chicken  O
Wings  O
/bbbbbb  O
were  O
deep  O
fried  O
to  O
a  O
nice  O
golden  O
brown  O
.  O

However  O
it  O
was  O
lacking  O
the  O
pungent  O
prawn  O
paste  O
taste  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
the  O
milder  O
version  O
of  O
the  O
prawn  O
paste  O
chicken  O
wings  O
which  O
suit  O
those  O
who  O
dislike  O
the  O
acquire  O
prawn  O
paste  O
taste  O
.  O

The  O
bbbbbb  O
Stir  O
Fried  O
Sambal  O
Tapiocal  O
Leaves  O
/bbbbbb  O
was  O
pretty  O
good  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
actually  O
not  O
too  O
spicy  O
but  O
fragrant  O
enough  O
,  O
not  O
overcooked  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O

to  O
it  O

I  O

the  O
bbbbbb  O

They  O
were  O
huge  O
and  O
packed  O

For  O
my  O
birthday  O
celebration  O
with  O
my  O
girlfriend  O
this  O
year  O
,  O
I  O
suggested  O
bbbbbb  O
The  O
Clan  O
Restaurant  O
/bbbbbb  O
which  O
is  O
nearby  O
our  O
staycation  O
at  O
PARKROYAL  O
on  O
Pickering  O
.  O

The  O
2  O
storeyrestaurant  O
is  O
nestled  O
inside  O
a  O
bbbbbb  O
100  O
over  O
years  O
old  O
building  O
/bbbbbb  O
that  O
is  O
also  O
bbbbbb  O
The  O
GAN  O
Clan  O
Association  O
/bbbbbb  O
.  O

The  O
restaurant  O
interior  O
is  O
pretty  O
dark  O
so  O
pardon  O
me  O
for  O
the  O
poor  O
quality  O
photos  O
.  O

I  O
did  O
n't  O
feel  O
good  O
using  O
my  O
flash  O
as  O
the  O
table  O
were  O
quite  O
close  O
to  O
one  O
another  O
not  O
to  O
mention  O
the  O
dimly  O
lit  O
environment  O
.  O

Upon  O
sitting  O
down  O
,  O
we  O
werepresented  O
with  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
6  O
course  O
dinner  O
set  O
menu  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
63.80++  O
per  O
pax  O
)  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
this  O
isdifferent  O
from  O
the  O
usual  O
practice  O
of  O
restaurants  O
where  O
they  O
prefer  O
you  O
to  O
order  O
from  O
their  O
ala  O
carte  O
menu  O
as  O
the  O
profit  O
margin  O
is  O
higher.Nevertheless  O
ala  O
carte  O
menu  O
is  O
availableon  O
request.After  O
comparing  O
the  O
2menus  O
,  O
we  O
decided  O
to  O
go  O
for  O
the  O
diner  O
set  O
which  O
is  O
more  O
value  O
for  O
money  O
.  O

Chef  O
Starter  O
4/5  O

Before  O
starting  O
our  O
6  O
course  O
meal  O
,  O
we  O
were  O
give  O
watermelon  O
shooter  O
served  O
in  O
a  O
test  O
tube  O
to  O
whet  O
our  O
appetite  O
.  O

The  O
Chef  O
Starter  O
is  O
the  O
only  O
item  O
on  O
the  O
menu  O
that  O
were  O
not  O
given  O
a  O
choice  O
.  O

The  O
Chef  O
Starter  O
comprised  O
of  O
a  O
trio  O
which  O
for  O
me  O
the  O
most  O
memorable  O
was  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
pan  O
seared  O
scallop  O
with  O
asparagus  O
and  O
truffle  O
foam  O
/bbbbbb  O

Oyster  O
3  O
Ways  O
3.5/5  O

For  O
the  O
cold  O
dish  O
there  O
were  O
4  O
choices  O
.  O

My  O
partner  O
had  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Alaskan  O
King  O
Crab  O
with  O
Homemade  O
Karashi  O
Dressing  O
/bbbbbb  O
while  O
I  O
had  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Oyster  O
3  O
Ways  O
/bbbbbb  O
.  O

The  O
oysters  O
were  O
fresh  O
and  O
fat  O
.  O

Among  O
the  O
3  O
styles  O
,  O
my  O
favourite  O
was  O
the  O
oyster  O
shooter  O
with  O
quail  O
egg  O
.  O

Initially  O
I  O
was  O
afraid  O
that  O
therawnesswill  O
be  O
too  O
much  O
for  O
me  O
to  O
stomach  O
but  O
there  O
was  O
an  O
interesting  O
zesty  O
sauce  O
that  O
brought  O
it  O
together  O
.  O

Deep  O
Fried  O

3/5  O

Out  O
of  O
the  O
5  O
choices  O
available  O
for  O
the  O
Side  O
Dish  O
,  O
my  O

the  O
Kurobuta  O
Pork  O
Belly  O

with  O
Pork  O
Cracker  O
&  O
Passion  O

,  O
Balsamico  O
Reduction  O
&  O

Focaccia  O
/bbbbbb  O
.  O

I  O
did  O
n't  O
quite  O
enjoyed  O
this  O
dish  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
the  O
foie  O
gras  O
lost  O
its  O
shine  O
in  O
the  O
dish  O
and  O
I  O
felt  O
like  O
having  O
deep  O
fried  O
wanton  O
with  O
minced  O
pork  O
filling  O
.  O

Crab  O
Bisque  O

Next  O
for  O
the  O

which  O
comes  O
with  O
another  O
4  O
choices  O
,  O
my  O
partner  O
had  O
the  O

Love  O
the  O
presentation  O
as  O
well  O
as  O
the  O
richness  O
and  O
robustness  O
of  O
the  O
flavours  O
.  O

Kurobuta  O
Pork  O
Jawl  O
4.2/5  O

For  O
the  O
Main  O
,  O
there  O
are  O
6  O
choices  O
.  O

My  O
partner  O
had  O
the  O
popular  O

Ribs  O
on  O

Pistachio  O
Puree  O
with  O
Pickled  O
Zucchini  O
&  O
64  O
Degree  O
Egg  O
Yolk  O
/bbbbbb  O
.  O

The  O
pork  O
cheek  O
was  O
fork  O
tender  O
with  O
a  O
flavourful  O
encrusting  O
and  O
nicely  O
balanced  O
with  O
the  O
egg  O
yolk  O
coating  O
.  O

You  O
may  O
wonder  O
where  O
is  O
my  O
sixth  O
course  O
,  O
Dessert  O
?  O

Well  O
we  O
did  O
have  O
it  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
served  O
after  O
a  O
longwait  O
and  O
I  O
forgot  O
to  O
take  O
photo  O
of  O
it  O
.  O

Anyway  O
there  O
are  O
5  O
choices  O
and  O
we  O
had  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Chocolate  O

/bbbbbb  O
and  O

.  O

Will  O
I  O
ever  O
come  O
back  O
to  O
the  O
restaurant  O
again  O
?  O

Yes  O
I  O
will  O
.  O

Although  O
we  O
had  O
the  O
set  O
menu  O
,  O
there  O
are  O
at  O
least  O
4  O
choices  O
for  O
each  O
course  O
.  O

Not  O
only  O
value  O
for  O
money  O
the  O
food  O
is  O
meticulous  O
and  O
exquisite  O
.  O

The  O
service  O
is  O
also  O
top  O
notch  O
except  O
for  O
the  O
moment  O
of  O
lapse  O
of  O
our  O
dessert  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
not  O
complaining  O
as  O
I  O
was  O
given  O
a  O
20  O
%  O

for  O
the  O
mistake  O

at  O

Cuisine  O
and  O

Nicole  O
,  O
Kimberley  O
and  O
meended  O
up  O
at  O
Truffs  O
in  O
Telok  O
Ayer  O
.  O

Our  O
initial  O
plan  O
was  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
Sophie  O
Bakery  O
but  O
it  O
was  O
closed  O
for  O
maintenance  O
.  O

We  O
were  O
really  O
disappointed  O
as  O
we  O
have  O
braved  O
the  O
hot  O
soaring  O
sun  O
walking  O
from  O
Raffles  O
Place  O
to  O
Telok  O
Ayer  O
.  O

There  O
was  O
a  O
moment  O
of  O
emptiness  O
in  O
us  O
until  O
Kimberley  O
suggested  O
Truffs  O
whichis  O
just  O
a  O
few  O
steps  O
away  O
.  O

Thank  O
god  O
we  O
have  O
chocolate  O
to  O
cheer  O
us  O
up  O
after  O
the  O
disappointment  O
at  O
Sophie  O
Bakery  O
(  O
closed  O
for  O
maintenance  O
)  O
.  O

Truff  O
is  O
located  O
on  O
the  O
second  O
floor  O
on  O
the  O
same  O
stretch  O
of  O
shophouses  O
with  O
Sophie  O
Bakery  O
but  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
door  O
steps  O
away  O
.  O

Kimberley  O
knows  O
about  O
this  O
place  O
because  O
she  O
bought  O
her  O
boyfriend  O
's  O
birthday  O
cake  O
from  O
Truffs  O
but  O
back  O
then  O
it  O
was  O
only  O
a  O
takeaway  O
kiosk  O
.  O

Truffs  O
has  O
since  O
expanded  O
with  O
a  O
sit  O
down  O
area  O
cum  O

where  O
patrons  O
can  O
enjoy  O
their  O

The  O
chocolate  O
beverages  O
were  O
velvety  O
,  O
rich  O
but  O
yet  O
not  O
too  O
sweet  O
.  O

The  O
ice  O
chocolate  O

4.5/5  O

I  O
am  O
grateful  O
that  O
Truffsnow  O
has  O
a  O
caf  O
area  O
so  O
I  O
gota  O
chance  O
to  O
savour  O
the  O
delicious  O
Chocolate  O
Cake  O
(  O

.  O

When  O
they  O
did  O
n't  O
have  O
the  O
caf  O
area  O
,  O
one  O
needs  O
to  O
buy  O
the  O
whole  O
cake  O
in  O
order  O
to  O
taste  O
this  O
delicious  O
chocolate  O
cake  O
.  O

The  O
chocolate  O
cake  O
was  O
light  O
,  O
fluffy  O
and  O
spongy  O
while  O
the  O
ganache  O
was  O
rich  O
but  O
not  O
too  O
sweet  O
.  O

It  O
had  O
a  O
harmonised  O
balance  O
thatI  O
did  O
n't  O
feel  O
sick  O
finishing  O
it  O
.  O

Earl  O
Grey  O
Chocolate  O
Tart  O
4/5  O

The  O
tart  O
at  O
Truffs  O
does  O
not  O
have  O
a  O
bottom  O
shell  O
but  O
replaced  O
with  O
a  O
crumbly  O
crusts  O
.  O

The  O
tart  O
comes  O
in  O
either  O
Earl  O
Grey  O
or  O
Espresso  O
infused  O
chocolate  O
ganache  O
.  O

We  O
tried  O
the  O
Earl  O
Grey  O
Chocolate  O
Tart  O
(  O
$  O
7  O
)  O
which  O
hasa  O
brilliant  O
combination  O
of  O
the  O
intense  O
and  O
velvety  O
tea  O
infused  O
chocolate  O
ganache  O
.  O

Truffs  O
is  O
definitely  O
a  O
chocolate  O
heaven  O
for  O
chocolate  O
lovers  O
for  O
their  O
exquisite  O
truffles  O
,  O
cakes  O
and  O
tarts  O
.  O

Although  O
the  O
caf  O
area  O
is  O
rather  O
spacious  O
,  O
I  O
like  O
the  O
fact  O
that  O
the  O
owner  O
did  O
not  O
fill  O
up  O
the  O
space  O
with  O
more  O
tables  O
and  O
seats  O
to  O
make  O
more  O
profit  O
.  O

The  O
caf  O
area  O
has  O
a  O
quiet  O
and  O
laid  O
back  O
charm  O
that  O
I  O
can  O
imagine  O
myself  O
relaxing  O
,  O
reading  O
a  O
book  O
while  O
sipping  O
a  O
cup  O
of  O
hot  O
chocolate  O

The  O
Milk  O
flavour  O
was  O
pretty  O
normal  O
but  O
I  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
chocolate  O
chunks  O
and  O
nuts  O
to  O
give  O
the  O
ice  O

an  O
enjoyable  O
bites  O

My  O
previous  O
visit  O
to  O
Azur  O
was  O
a  O
couple  O
of  O
years  O
ago  O
for  O
a  O
corporate  O
lunch  O
when  O
Crowne  O
Plaza  O
Changi  O
Airport  O
was  O
newly  O
built  O
.  O

I  O
remembered  O
the  O
buffet  O
spread  O
was  O
quite  O
extensive  O
showcasing  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
best  O
local  O
favourites  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
back  O
at  O
the  O
Azur  O
at  O
Crowne  O
Plaza  O
Changi  O
Airport  O
to  O
try  O
out  O
their  O
new  O
Weekend  O
Changi  O
Brunch  O
menu  O
.  O

Azur  O
has  O
brought  O
together  O
the  O
best  O
of  O
the  O
East  O
and  O
West  O
in  O
a  O
refreshed  O
menu  O
of  O
the  O
popular  O
Weekend  O
Changi  O

featuring  O
local  O
and  O
international  O
cuisines  O
.  O

German  O
Sausages  O
with  O
Juniper  O
Berry  O
Sauerkraut  O
and  O
Beef  O
Jus  O
4.5/5  O

One  O
of  O
the  O
memorable  O
items  O
I  O
tried  O
at  O
the  O
brunch  O
buffet  O
is  O
the  O
German  O
Sausages  O
with  O
Juniper  O
Berry  O
Sauerkraut  O
and  O
Beef  O
Jus  O
.  O

The  O
highlight  O
for  O
me  O
is  O
the  O
sauerkraut  O
,  O
this  O
is  O
a  O
must  O
have  O
combination  O
for  O
eating  O
sausages  O
.  O

Some  O
restaurants  O
only  O
served  O
sausages  O
with  O
mustard  O
.  O

Iam  O
delight  O
that  O
Azur  O
took  O
the  O
effort  O
to  O
prepare  O
the  O
juniper  O
berry  O
sauerkraut  O
.  O

Baked  O

juicy  O
,  O
baked  O
with  O
the  O
flavoursome  O
aioli  O
herb  O
.  O

Pan  O
Seared  O
Fish  O
Fillet  O
with  O
Yuzu  O
Orange  O
Sauce  O
3/5  O

The  O
Pan  O
Seared  O
Fish  O
Fillet  O
was  O
cooked  O
in  O
a  O
delectable  O
Yuzu  O
Orange  O
Sauce  O
.  O

The  O
moistfish  O
was  O
further  O
lifted  O
and  O
enhanced  O
by  O
the  O
tangy  O
sauce  O
.  O

Roasted  O
Chicken  O
with  O
Homemade  O
Chilli  O
Sauce  O
3/5  O

The  O
Roasted  O
Chicken  O
with  O
Homemade  O
Chilli  O
Sauce  O
was  O
pretty  O
good  O
,  O
succulent  O
and  O
flavourful  O
.  O

Oh  O
the  O
chilli  O
saucewas  O
not  O

always  O
likePhilippines  O
Clams  O
because  O
they  O
are  O
quitesweet  O
.  O

Love  O
the  O
version  O
by  O
Azur  O
marinated  O
with  O
white  O
wine  O
and  O
shallots  O
which  O
was  O
very  O
addictive  O
.  O

Rojak  O

For  O
a  O
taste  O
of  O
the  O
local  O
hawker  O

Delight  O
Noodles  O
Bar.A  O
good  O
change  O
from  O
the  O
usual  O
Laksa  O
but  O
I  O
still  O
thought  O
the  O
latter  O
is  O
still  O
a  O
better  O
representation  O
of  O
the  O
local  O
favourite  O
.  O

Cold  O
Dishes  O

I  O
love  O
the  O
array  O
of  O
Asian  O
and  O
Western  O
food  O
at  O
Azur  O
Weekend  O
Changi  O
Brunch  O
but  O
I  O
do  O
n't  O
have  O
a  O
huge  O
stomach  O
for  O
all  O
the  O
delectable  O
food  O
.  O

I  O
went  O
for  O
3  O
rounds  O
only  O
while  O
the  O
others  O
were  O
shared  O
with  O
my  O
dining  O
partners  O
.  O

Started  O
with  O
some  O
cold  O
dishes  O

my  O
favourite  O
on  O
the  O

the  O
oysters  O
and  O
crab  O
.  O

Cooked  O
Food  O

From  O
the  O

the  O
German  O
sausages  O
,  O
Baked  O
Mussels  O
and  O
Steak  O
.  O

Dessert  O

Definitely  O
we  O

the  O
sumptuous  O
lunch  O
with  O
a  O
round  O
of  O
sweetness  O
from  O
the  O

If  O

the  O
local  O

can  O
try  O
creating  O

a  O
street  O
in  O
Western  O
Australia  O
opened  O
its  O
door  O
about  O
2  O
months  O
back  O
.  O

The  O

by  O
a  O

,  O
Kelvin  O

/bbbbbb  O
(  O

to  O
kick  O
start  O

.  O

I  O
do  O
n't  O
like  O
my  O
coffee  O
to  O
be  O
too  O
acidic  O
hence  O
I  O
quite  O
enjoyed  O
the  O
cup  O
of  O
coffee  O
at  O
Rokeby  O
which  O
maybe  O
a  O
bit  O
too  O
bitter  O
for  O
some  O
.  O

Full  O

All  O
of  O
us  O
ordered  O

hence  O
it  O
is  O
a  O
bit  O
ofinjustice  O
to  O
the  O

in  O
this  O

.  O

Nevertheless  O
,  O
this  O
was  O
some  O
of  O
the  O
items  O
we  O
ordered  O
from  O
the  O

till  O

For  O

go  O
for  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
French  O

/bbbbbb  O
(  O

that  O
comes  O
with  O

served  O
with  O

and  O
baked  O
beans  O
on  O
the  O
side  O
.  O

Ham  O
and  O
Cheese  O
Omelette  O
3.5/5  O

Actually  O
my  O
friend  O
and  O
I  O
wanted  O
to  O
order  O
the  O
Egg  O
Benedict  O
but  O
after  O
taking  O
our  O
orders  O
,  O
the  O
waitress  O
came  O
back  O
5  O
minutes  O
later  O
informing  O
us  O
that  O
they  O
have  O
ran  O
out  O
of  O
poached  O
eggs  O
,  O
asking  O
us  O
to  O
change  O
to  O
scrambled  O
egg  O
or  O
other  O
style  O
of  O
eggs  O
for  O
our  O
egg  O
benedict  O
?  O

I  O
thought  O
that  O
was  O
quite  O
weird  O
since  O
the  O
kitchen  O
can  O
prepare  O
other  O
styles  O
of  O
egg  O
but  O
not  O
poached  O
egg  O
.  O

Anyway  O
my  O
friend  O
changed  O
her  O
order  O
and  O
had  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Ham  O
and  O
Cheese  O
Omelette  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
12.90  O
)  O
that  O
is  O
served  O
with  O
salad  O
,  O
baked  O
beans  O
and  O
toast  O
on  O
the  O
side  O
.  O

Vegemite  O
Downunder  O
3.8/5  O

What  O
is  O
egg  O
benedict  O
without  O
poached  O
eggs  O
so  O
I  O
also  O
changed  O
my  O
order  O
to  O
bbbbbb  O
Vegemite  O
Downunder  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
10.90  O
)  O
.  O

This  O
brought  O
back  O
a  O
lot  O
of  O
childhood  O
memories  O
when  O
I  O
used  O
to  O
spread  O
my  O
toast  O
with  O
vegemite  O
.  O

Paired  O
with  O
the  O
creamy  O
scrambled  O
eggs  O
with  O
salad  O
and  O
baked  O
beans  O
on  O
the  O
side  O
this  O
is  O
a  O
hearty  O
breakfast  O
the  O
Aussie  O
way  O
.  O

The  O
brunch  O
menu  O
at  O
Rokeby  O
is  O
pretty  O
decent  O
but  O
service  O
was  O
pretty  O
slow  O
.  O

Considering  O
the  O
kitchen  O
is  O
pretty  O
small  O
and  O
they  O
are  O
only  O
2  O
months  O
into  O
operations  O
,  O
hopefully  O
it  O
can  O
only  O
get  O
better  O
.  O

I  O
look  O
forward  O
to  O
go  O
back  O
to  O
the  O
bistro  O
and  O
try  O
their  O
mains  O
when  O
operations  O
are  O
smooth  O
running  O

I  O
did  O
n't  O
plan  O
to  O
make  O
any  O
reservation  O
for  O
this  O

Restaurant  O
Week  O
March  O

since  O
I  O

of  O
the  O

So  O
how  O
did  O
I  O
end  O
up  O
at  O
bbbbbb  O
Gunther  O

?  O

If  O
I  O
remembered  O
correctly  O
,  O
it  O
all  O
started  O
with  O
Daniel  O
tweeting  O
his  O
restaurant  O
week  O
's  O
experience  O
at  O
Gunther  O
's  O
French  O
Modern  O

.  O

That  O
started  O
a  O
chain  O
of  O
conversations  O
on  O
Twitter  O
with  O
some  O
friends  O
and  O
eventually  O
we  O
ended  O
up  O
making  O
reservation  O
for  O
a  O

/bbbbbb  O
.  O

The  O
thinly  O
sliced  O
beautiful  O
marbled  O
wagyu  O

was  O
topped  O
with  O
a  O
medley  O
of  O

that  O
accentuated  O
the  O
sweetness  O
of  O
the  O

was  O
a  O

with  O

simply  O
shows  O
the  O
details  O
the  O
chef  O
has  O
put  O
into  O
his  O

Even  O
without  O
the  O
caviar  O
which  O
was  O
substituted  O
with  O
tomato  O
,  O
mozzarella  O
and  O
ham  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
nothing  O
shy  O
of  O
excellent  O
.  O

a  O
nice  O
contrast  O
in  O

,  O
it  O
also  O
given  O

a  O

that  O
lifted  O
the  O
whole  O
enjoyment  O
of  O
the  O
delicacy  O
.  O

The  O

so  O
tender  O

the  O

was  O
not  O

The  O
delicately  O

I  O

excited  O
because  O
I  O
have  O
not  O
tried  O
the  O

in  O
Hong  O

I  O
am  O
glad  O
that  O
Chef  O

has  O
decided  O
to  O
bring  O
it  O
to  O
Singapore  O

Now  O
I  O
can  O
just  O

on  O

Dine  O
In  O
Area  O

The  O
restaurant  O
at  O

is  O
divided  O
in  O
two  O
sections  O
.  O

A  O
dine-in  O
area  O
that  O
can  O
sit  O
up  O
to  O
100  O
customers  O
and  O
a  O

customers  O
who  O
wish  O
to  O

In  O
one  O
of  O
Chef  O

he  O
correctly  O
pointed  O
out  O
that  O
Singaporean  O

at  O

.  O

Some  O
of  O
us  O
prefer  O
the  O
fried  O
style  O
where  O
the  O
carrot  O
cake  O
is  O
more  O
crisp  O
and  O
firm  O
.  O

I  O
am  O
the  O
opposite  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
my  O
carrot  O
cake  O
steamed  O
.  O

I  O
thought  O
the  O
pan  O
fried  O
carrot  O
cake  O
was  O
well  O
executed  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
layer  O
of  O
crisp  O
on  O
the  O
exterior  O
while  O
the  O
inside  O
was  O
still  O
soft  O
and  O
moist  O
with  O
shreds  O
of  O
radish  O

Resembling  O

,  O
the  O
Steamed  O
Egg  O
Cake  O
(  O
$  O
3.80  O

1pc  O
)  O
was  O
surprisingly  O
very  O
good  O
.  O

A  O
distinct  O
egg  O
taste  O
which  O
felt  O
like  O
eating  O
Tamago  O
while  O
the  O
texture  O
was  O
light  O
and  O
spongy  O
like  O
a  O
cake  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
one  O
of  O
my  O
favourite  O
because  O
I  O
have  O
not  O
eaten  O
anything  O
like  O
it  O

A  O
bold  O
twist  O
from  O
the  O
tradition  O
where  O

is  O
commonly  O
stuffed  O
with  O

Another  O

mentioned  O
in  O
one  O
of  O
his  O
interviews  O
,  O
he  O
has  O
tested  O
the  O
local  O
pig  O

until  O
he  O
was  O
satisfied  O
with  O
the  O
texture  O
although  O
there  O
is  O
still  O
a  O
slight  O
different  O
compare  O
to  O
the  O

Everyone  O
on  O

eagerly  O
waiting  O
for  O
it  O

I  O
already  O
have  O
the  O
expectation  O
that  O
this  O
is  O
going  O
to  O
be  O
good  O
but  O
sinking  O
my  O

into  O
it  O

it  O
way  O
beyond  O
my  O
description  O
of  O
just  O
good  O

It  O
was  O

Even  O

the  O

up  O

I  O

The  O

was  O
smooth  O

sturdy  O
wrapping  O

was  O
so  O

that  O
we  O

I  O
have  O
always  O
noticed  O
a  O

at  O
bbbbbb  O
Song  O
Kee  O
Fishball  O

/bbbbbb  O
along  O
Upper  O
Serangoon  O
Road  O
whenever  O
I  O
am  O
on  O
my  O
way  O
home  O
and  O
I  O
have  O
always  O
wanted  O
to  O
check  O
out  O
the  O
place  O
.  O

Managed  O
to  O
ask  O
a  O
friend  O
who  O
stays  O
at  O
Serangoon  O
one  O
evening  O
to  O
join  O
me  O
.  O

When  O
I  O
reached  O
the  O
place  O
around  O
1130pm  O
,  O
the  O
place  O
was  O
already  O
pretty  O
crowded  O
with  O
many  O
tables  O
waiting  O
for  O
their  O
order  O
.  O

I  O
was  O
told  O
that  O
I  O
need  O
to  O
wait  O
for  O
30  O
minutes  O
and  O
indeed  O
I  O
did  O
.  O

Mee  O

We  O
ordered  O
a  O
bowl  O
of  O
bbbbbb  O
Mee  O

(  O

and  O
bbbbbb  O
Mee  O
Pok  O
Dry  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O
3.50  O
)  O
.  O

Each  O
bowl  O
of  O
noodle  O
came  O
with  O
3  O
fishballs  O
,  O
a  O
fish  O
dumpling  O
(  O
Her  O
Giao  O
)  O
and  O
a  O
Tao  O
Pok  O
stuffed  O
with  O
fish  O
paste  O
.  O

The  O
noodles  O
and  O
chilli  O
sauce  O
were  O
rather  O
normal  O
.  O

The  O
star  O
has  O
to  O
be  O
their  O
ingredients  O
and  O
the  O
used  O
of  O
pork  O

.  O

Mee  O
Pok  O
Dry  O
4/5  O

The  O
fishball  O
that  O
is  O
about  O
the  O
size  O
of  O
a  O
ping  O
pong  O
ball  O
is  O
made  O
from  O
yellowtail  O
.  O

The  O
fishball  O
was  O
springy  O
and  O
bouncy  O
.  O

I  O
like  O
the  O
fish  O
dumpling  O
(  O
Her  O
Giao  O
)  O
the  O
most  O
.  O

Biting  O
into  O
the  O
fish  O
dumpling  O
,  O
the  O
aroma  O
of  O
the  O
shallot  O
oil  O
from  O
the  O
filling  O
simply  O
filled  O
the  O
whole  O
mouth  O
.  O

I  O
only  O
visit  O
I  O
can  O
have  O
more  O
of  O
them  O
in  O
my  O
bowl  O
of  O
noodle  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
been  O
observing  O
but  O
still  O
ca  O
n't  O
figure  O
out  O
why  O
the  O
uncle  O
takes  O
so  O
long  O
to  O
cook  O
a  O
bowl  O
of  O
noodle  O
.  O

His  O
motion  O
was  O
pretty  O
fast  O
and  O
it  O
does  O
n't  O
seem  O
to  O
have  O
unnecessary  O
action  O
.  O

Anyway  O
,  O
if  O
you  O
do  O
visit  O
Song  O
Kee  O
Fishball  O
Noodle  O
and  O
there  O
is  O
a  O
crowd  O
,  O
proceed  O
to  O
make  O
your  O
order  O
and  O
take  O
a  O
queue  O
number  O
first  O
before  O
finding  O
a  O
seat  O
.  O

The  O
wait  O
can  O
be  O
quite  O
long  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
drinks  O
you  O
can  O
take  O
it  O
yourself  O
from  O
the  O
fridge  O
first  O
.  O

Just  O
pay  O
together  O
with  O
the  O
noodle  O
when  O
it  O
is  O
served  O

This  O
is  O

an  O
achievement  O
for  O

bbbbbb  O
Principessa  O

an  O
eclectic  O
mix  O
of  O
roasted  O
pumpkin  O
,  O
avocado  O
,  O
asparagus  O
,  O
tomato  O
,  O
french  O
beans  O
and  O
boccocini  O
,  O
all  O
mingled  O
in  O
a  O
bed  O
of  O
mixed  O
lettuces  O
and  O
dressed  O
in  O
a  O
light  O
balsamic  O
vinaigrette  O
that  O
was  O
subtle  O
and  O
unassuming  O
.  O

Basilico  O
3.5/5  O

The  O
bbbbbb  O
Basilico  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O

is  O
homemade  O
herb  O
bread  O
with  O
creamy  O
goat  O

,  O
char  O
grilled  O
eggplant  O
and  O
roasted  O

and  O
rocket  O

The  O
bruschetta  O
has  O
a  O
nice  O

that  O
will  O
whet  O
your  O
appetite  O

The  O
bbbbbb  O
Eggplant  O
and  O
Parsnip  O
Fritters  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O

)  O
drizzled  O
with  O
zesty  O
house  O
mayo  O
was  O
rather  O
simple  O
with  O
a  O
light  O
batter  O
but  O
was  O
surprisingly  O
quite  O
delectable  O
with  O
a  O
nice  O
exterior  O
crisp  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
my  O
first  O
time  O
having  O
parsnip  O
and  O
I  O
thought  O
the  O
texture  O
is  O
quite  O
similar  O
to  O
potato  O
,  O
very  O
enjoyable  O
.  O

Haloumi  O

The  O
bbbbbb  O
Haloumi  O
/bbbbbb  O
(  O
$  O

which  O
is  O
usually  O
made  O
from  O
a  O
mixture  O
of  O
goat  O
's  O
milk  O

roasted  O
capsicum  O

.  O

Due  O
to  O
its  O
high  O
melting  O
point  O
,  O
the  O
haloumi  O
is  O
ideal  O
to  O
be  O
served  O
pan  O
fried  O
or  O
grilled  O
giving  O
it  O
a  O
nice  O
texture  O
