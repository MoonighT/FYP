I  O

quite  O

me  O
at  O

was  O

be  O
able  O
to  O

the  O

of  O

know  O
it  O

My  O

so  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Sio  B-F
Bak  I-F
/bbbbbb  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
cold  O

The  O
first  O
thing  O
I  O
noticed  O
was  O
how  O
beautiful  O
the  O
different  O
layers  O
of  O
of  O
the  O
pork  O
belly  O
was  O
basically  O
belly  O
dancing  O
in  O
a  O
seductive  O
matter  O
seducing  O
me  O
to  O
eat  O
them  O
up  O
quickly  O
.  O

Sinking  O
my  O
teeth  O
into  O
the  O
seductive  O
piece  O
of  O
roast  O
pork  O
.  O

My  O
first  O
response  O
was  O
that  O
the  O
blistered  O
skin  O
tasted  O
special  O
.  O

Even  O
though  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
bit  O
cold  O
,  O
the  O
skin  O
still  O
has  O
that  O
crackling  O
and  O
crumbly  O
texture  O
.  O

Borrowing  O
Seetoh  O
's  O
description  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
biscuit  O
like  O
.  O

In  O
my  O
second  O
visit  O
I  O
was  O
earlier  O
and  O
I  O
got  O
to  O
try  O
the  O
roasted  O
pork  O
while  O
it  O
was  O
still  O
warm  O
.  O

The  O
piece  O
of  O
sio  O
bak  O
literally  O
melted  O
in  O
my  O
mouth  O
.  O

The  O
blistered  O
skin  O
still  O
has  O
that  O
biscuit  O
like  O
texture  O
which  O
is  O
really  O
very  O
enjoyable  O
.  O

I  O
felt  O
that  O
my  O
limited  O
vocabulary  O
did  O
not  O
do  O
justification  O
to  O
the  O
beautiful  O
piece  O
of  O
roasted  B-F

belly  I-F
.  O

have  O
to  O

For  O

my  O

is  O
to  O
go  O
for  O
the  O

has  O

The  O

I  O
like  O
that  O

I  O
ended  O
up  O

the  O

I  O

Striking  O
up  O
a  O
conversation  O
with  O

,  O
I  O
realised  O
she  O
is  O
the  O
owner  O
of  O

.  O

It  O
was  O
her  O
passion  O
for  O
a  O
good  O
cup  O
of  O
brew  O
that  O
she  O
opened  O
the  O
cafe  O

She  O
self  O
thought  O
herself  O
the  O

spending  O
thousands  O

perfecting  O
it  O
,  O
trying  O
out  O

She  O
was  O
so  O

and  O
even  O
can  O
tell  O
me  O
the  O
preferred  O
taste  O
of  O
her  O

I  O
could  O
sensed  O
the  O
enthusiasm  O
in  O
her  O
when  O
we  O
talked  O
about  O

I  O
admired  O
her  O

I  O

they  O
should  O
consider  O
selling  O

is  O
not  O

The  O
restaurant  O
gets  O
their  O
rice  O
vermicelli  O
from  O
Vietnam  O
directly  O
.  O

The  O
quality  O
was  O
pretty  O
obvious  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
not  O
clumpy  O
and  O
the  O
texture  O
was  O
silky  O

The  O
tangy  O
broth  O
of  O
fish  O
sauce  O
and  O
tomato  O
is  O
further  O
elevated  O
with  O
a  O

which  O
is  O
a  O
traditional  O
dish  O
rarely  O
find  O
at  O

nowadays  O
because  O
it  O
is  O

Usually  O
what  O
we  O
have  O
elsewhere  O
is  O
the  O
starchy  O
version  O
that  O
is  O
quite  O
similar  O
to  O
our  O

Here  O
the  O
fish  O

are  O
sliced  O

you  O
a  O

which  O
has  O
a  O

If  O
I  O
am  O
not  O
wrong  O
,  O

added  O

giving  O
it  O
a  O
nice  O

As  O
I  O
mentioned  O
it  O

hence  O

The  O
huge  O

expensive  O
but  O
I  O
know  O
I  O
am  O
paying  O
for  O
the  O
freshness  O
and  O
quality  O
.  O

I  O
have  O
to  O
say  O
every  O
time  O
I  O
ordered  O
the  O
steamed  O
promfret  O
,  O
the  O
timing  O
they  O
steamed  O
the  O
fish  O
has  O
always  O
been  O
perfect  O
.  O

Besides  O
the  O
above  O

I  O
tried  O
,  O
Ah  O

also  O

which  O
are  O
both  O
very  O

However  O
I  O
have  O
to  O
warn  O
that  O
the  O
price  O
here  O
is  O
not  O
cheap  O

do  O
n't  O
be  O
shock  O
by  O

at  O

end  O
of  O
the  O

being  O

It  O
somewhat  O
tastes  O
like  O
mapo  O
tofu  O
initially  O
but  O
as  O
the  O
vinegar  O
hits  O
the  O
palate  O
,  O
the  O
picture  O
of  O
a  O
bowl  O
of  O
bak  O

noodle  O
sets  O
in  O
.  O

Interestingly  O
,  O
I  O
felt  O
like  O
I  O
was  O
having  O
tofu  O
instead  O
of  O
beancurd  O
without  O
noticing  O
the  O
soya  O
flavour  O
,  O
probably  O
covered  O
by  O
the  O
flavourful  O
chilli  O
oil  O
and  O
vinegar  O
.  O

The  O
signature  B-F
savoury  I-F
beancurd  I-F
itself  O
can  O
be  O
quite  O
heavy  O
and  O
filling  O
,  O
so  O
it  O
is  O
better  O
to  O
share  O
.  O

In  O
my  O
humble  O
opinion  O
Mr  B-ORG
Bean  I-ORG
needs  O
to  O
have  O
a  O
more  O
catchy  O
English  O
name  O
for  O
the  O
beancurd  O
as  O
the  O
current  O
name  O
is  O
too  O
generic  O
and  O
does  O
not  O
really  O
represent  O
the  O
dish  O
unlike  O
the  O
Chinese  O
name  O
of  O
the  O
beancurd  O
.  O

Actually  O
the  O
people  O
behind  O
Siam  B-ORG
Society  I-ORG
is  O
the  O
same  O
owner  O
of  O
Soi  O
Thai  O
Kitchen  O
at  O
Tampines  O
.  O

Having  O
try  O
their  O
food  O
before  O
,  O
I  O
am  O
glad  O
that  O
the  O
owner  O
has  O
continued  O
to  O
ensure  O
that  O
the  O
food  O
is  O
as  O
authentic  O
as  O
possible  O
with  O
the  O
distinct  O
sharp  O
flavours  O
of  O
Thai  O
cuisine  O
.  O

What  O
I  O
noticed  O
is  O
the  O
heart  O
put  O
into  O
preparing  O
the  O
food  O
with  O
a  O
different  O
homemade  O
dipping  O
sauce  O
to  O
accompany  O
each  O
dish  O
.  O

With  O
such  O
heart  O
and  O
soul  O
,  O
I  O
am  O
sure  O
to  O
be  O
back  O
again  O
for  O
their  O
Thai  O
food  O
.  O

The  O
lobster  O
soup  O
goes  O
pretty  O
well  O
with  O
almost  O
all  O
the  O
ingredients  O
.  O

The  O
soup  O
base  O
itself  O
was  O
rich  O
and  O
flavourful  O
.  O

For  O
the  O
satay  O
soup  O
,  O
it  O
has  O
a  O
nice  O
nutty  O
finishing  O
but  O
can  O
be  O
a  O
bit  O
unique  O
for  O
some  O
people  O
.  O

May  O
not  O
be  O
too  O
suitable  O
for  O
all  O
the  O
ingredients  O
.  O

Overall  O
it  O
is  O
still  O
quite  O
an  O

up  O
with  O

The  O

This  O

I  O
was  O

reminisce  O
the  O

With  O
more  O
and  O
more  O
diners  O
avoiding  O
eating  O

it  O

bbbbbb  O

/bbbbbb  O
which  O
I  O
personally  O
felt  O
is  O
a  O
good  O
alternative  O
.  O

The  O
sumptuous  O
bowl  O
of  O
fish  O
maw  O
soup  O
is  O
loaded  O
with  O
many  O
ingredients  O
such  O
as  O
the  O
crab  O
meat  O
,  O
mushroom  O
,  O
shrimp  O
,  O
and  O
fish  O
maw  O
.  O

Add  O
a  O
bit  O
of  O
vinegar  O
and  O
pepper  O
,  O
it  O
is  O
as  O
delicious  O
as  O

Prawn  B-F
Roll  I-F
4.8/5  S

I  O
always  O
have  O
this  O
doubt  O
whether  O
I  O
have  O
bbbbbb  O
Prawn  B-F
Roll  I-F
/bbbbbb  O
.  O

Why  O
is  O
it  O
call  O
prawn  O
roll  O
when  O
the  O
filling  O
mixture  O
has  O
more  O
minced  O
meat  O
and  O
hardly  O
traceable  O
prawn  O
in  O
it  O
.  O

At  O
Gim  O
Tim  O
,  O
a  O
must  O
order  O
dish  O
definitely  O
is  O
their  O
prawn  O
roll  O
.  O

Unlike  O
other  O
places  O
,  O
the  O
filling  O
is  O
white  O
in  O
colour  O
.  O

Chef  O
told  O
me  O
that  O
he  O
used  O
only  O
prawns  O
,  O
pork  O
fat  O
and  O
waterchest  O
nut  O
for  O
the  O
filling  O
only  O
.  O

That  O
explains  O
the  O
colouring  O
.  O

Unlike  O
other  O
places  O
where  O
the  O
fillings  O
were  O
mostly  O
minced  O
pork  O
causing  O
the  O
prawn  O
rolls  O
to  O
be  O
darker  O

Fried  B-F
Fresh  I-F
Scallops  I-F
with  I-F

/bbbbbb  O
is  O

a  O

dish  O
which  O
is  O
quite  O
commonly  O
served  O
in  O
wedding  O
banquet  O
.  O

I  O
love  O
my  O
greens  O
and  O
they  O
were  O
cooked  O
perfectly  O
still  O
retaining  O
that  O
crunchy  O
bite  O
.  O

However  O
the  O
scallops  O
came  O
across  O
as  O
a  O

does  O
not  O
only  O
needs  O
to  O

it  O
has  O
to  O
look  O

too  O

already  O
whetted  O
up  O
my  O
appetite  O
and  O
I  O
could  O
not  O
wait  O
to  O
dig  O
into  O
it  O
.  O

The  O
homemade  O
beancurd  O
was  O
really  O
excellent  O
with  O
its  O
smooth  O

to  O
the  O
delectable  O
duck  O
meat  O
that  O
fell  O
of  O
the  O
bone  O
with  O
ease  O
.  O

The  O
disappointment  O
was  O
the  O
sea  O
cucumber  O
that  O
probably  O
needed  O
a  O
bit  O
more  O
time  O
in  O

I  O
was  O
told  O
that  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O
Tapioca  B-F
Kueh  I-F
with  I-F
Spicy  I-F
Shrimp  I-F
/bbbbbb  O
is  O
a  O
very  O
traditional  O
Hokkien  O
dish  O
that  O
is  O
not  O
commonly  O
served  O
at  O
restaurants  O
nowadays  O
.  O

At  O
first  O
glance  O
,  O
it  O
looked  O
like  O
a  O
plate  O
of  O
fried  O
carrot  O
cake  O
.  O

This  O
is  O
my  O
first  O
time  O
having  O
the  O
tapioca  O
kueh  O
which  O
has  O
a  O
very  O
chewy  O
texture  O
.  O

The  O
texture  O
resembled  O
that  O
of  O
those  O
pearls  O
in  O
bubble  O
tea  O
.  O

The  O
more  O
you  O
chew  O
on  O
it  O
the  O
more  O
you  O
get  O
to  O
like  O
it  O

dish  O
is  O
the  O
bbbbbb  O

However  O
the  O
version  O
at  O

was  O
not  O

tender  O
as  O
I  O
would  O

Pudding  I-F
4.5/5  S

The  O
refreshing  O
bbbbbb  O
Young  B-F
Cocount  I-F
Pudding  I-F
/bbbbbb  O
is  O
probably  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
best  O
desserts  O
I  O
ever  O
had  O
.  O

Using  O
the  O
coconut  O
water  O
,  O
it  O
was  O
made  O
into  O
a  O
pudding  O
.  O

Once  O
the  O
pudding  O
is  O
formed  O
,  O
a  O
layer  O
of  O
mango  O
puree  O
is  O
poured  O
into  O
the  O
coconut  O
husk  O
and  O
topped  O
with  O
diced  O
fruits  O
.  O

The  O
interesting  O
combination  O
was  O
so  O
good  O
that  O
I  O
could  O
not  O
help  O
going  O
back  O
for  O
more  O
.  O

more  O
the  O
coconut  O
flesh  O
can  O
be  O
enjoyed  O

the  O
bbbbbb  O
Yam  B-F
Paste  I-F
/bbbbbb  O
to  O
wrap  O
up  O
the  O

For  O
health  O
conscious  O
reason  O
,  O
the  O
restaurant  O
has  O
stopped  O
using  O
pork  O
lard  O
for  O
the  O
yam  O
paste  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
nice  O
but  O
lacked  O
the  O
aroma  O
of  O
the  O
unhealthy  O
porky  O
fat  O
.  O

This  O
Chinese  O
restaurant  O
in  O

It  O
is  O
an  O

giving  O
it  O
that  O

the  O

I  O
probably  O
will  O
give  O
the  O

I  O
really  O
think  O
this  O
will  O
be  O
well  O
received  O
by  O

it  O
needed  O
some  O

The  O
stall  O
has  O
created  O
this  O
simple  O
yet  O
complicated  O
dish  O
specially  O
to  O
suit  O
the  O
local  O
taste  O
buds  O
.  O

Why  O
so  O
?  O

It  O
is  O
because  O
the  O
simplest  O
dish  O
to  O
make  O
is  O
actually  O
the  O
most  O
complicated  O
.  O

For  O
me  O
it  O
is  O
either  O
you  O
hate  O
it  O
or  O
like  O
it  O
.  O

Why  O
so  O
?  O

The  O
reason  O
is  O
the  O
noodle  O
.  O

In  O
terms  O
of  O
texture  O
the  O
thin  O
noodles  O
really  O
has  O
a  O
very  O
springy  O
and  O
enjoyable  O
texture  O
.  O

However  O
it  O
has  O
an  O
alkaline  O
taste  O
that  O
was  O
still  O
acceptable  O
to  O
me  O
but  O
may  O
not  O
for  O
many  O
.  O

The  O
stall  O
is  O
still  O
pretty  O
new  O
and  O
it  O
is  O
still  O
going  O
through  O
refinement  O
and  O
adjustment  O
of  O
the  O
ultimate  O
noodle  O
dish  O
.  O

I  O
look  O
forward  O
for  O
the  O
stall  O
to  O
achieve  O
the  O
dream  O
of  O
serving  O
their  O
Singapore  O

not  O

JohorKaki  O
!  O

As  O
you  O
may  O
know  O
Maureen  O
aka  O
MissTamChiak  O
and  O
me  O
have  O
organised  O
several  O
hawker  O
food  O
trails  O
and  O
foodies  O
gatherings  O
,  O
Tony  O
has  O
also  O
joined  O
us  O
on  O
a  O
few  O
occasions  O
.  O

It  O
was  O
at  O
one  O
of  O
these  O
gatherings  O
we  O
discussed  O
about  O
doing  O
a  O
Johor  O
food  O
trail  O
and  O
finally  O
we  O
put  O
it  O
to  O
plan  O
on  O
11  O
March  O
2013  O
on  O
a  O
Monday  O
morning  O
.  O

After  O
meeting  O
Tony  O
at  O
8am  O
,  O
he  O
drove  O
us  O
into  O
Johor  O
.  O

Traffic  O
was  O
quite  O
smooth  O
since  O
its  O
a  O
Monday  O
morning  O
and  O
within  O
15  O
minutes  O
we  O
were  O
at  O
the  O
other  O
side  O
of  O
the  O
causeway  O

Usually  O

both  O

I  O
preferred  O
the  O
plain  O
roti  O
canai  O
over  O
the  O

.  O

The  O
roti  O

seems  O
a  O

more  O

compared  O
to  O
the  O
one  O
I  O

this  O

the  O
star  O
is  O
the  O

the  O

The  O
egg  O

seem  O
to  O
have  O
a  O
more  O
